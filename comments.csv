I went to school for five years, read a lot, wrote a bunch of papers, went insane because of finals and deadlines and the only worthwhile thing I learned is that it would have been so much smarter to go to college and study something that would have actually given me a better chance of being placed in a job that I enjoy/is related to my field of study. 

Also, I chose a university known for its prestige because it was conveniently located close to home so I never lived on campus. As a commuter, I feel like I never got to experience ""college life"" fully. I never really made any friends.

JeTeSalueMonSoleil,"Those years thinking of excuses instead of seeing my deep intrinsic freedom.

Edit: Because some people seem to be wondering: 
I guess what I’m saying is this: We are all fundamentally free to choose the life we want. Anytime we say this is not the case we rationalize & conceptualize (i.e. create excuses) to convince ourselves it’s not fear keeping us from our dreams but our circumstances. Our inner arguments can be very persuasive and can make very valid points but in the end it is still us making a choice. My nature, upbringing, peer group etc. made me the person I am today but that does not mean those things decide for me. When I realize this, then right at that moment I am deeply free and this feels extremely liberating. (Mad props to existentialism and mindfulness)

kitesinfection,"As cliched as this will sound I'm going to say it was my high-school relationship that lasted for a bit over three years. I started dating the girl right before the end of my junior year, she was two years behind me and we had been friends for about two years. Normally something like this wouldn't be very bad, it's high-school! It's not like the relationship will matter in a few years except with this one my whole life was altered. I started going to church with this girl even though I didn't believe in god, I stopped hanging out with some really good friends so I could spend time with her. My life would most likely be on a completely different axis if not for her because of all the bridges burnt for her sake. I even put every single penny I earned towards a future for us. It was high-school, we were never going to end up together, deep down I knew that but, love man. Love. It makes you do stupid crap and you know what, even though it was the biggest waste of time in my entire life, I'd give up just about anything to experience it again because when that relationship worked, I was truly happy. 

EDIT: This post has got a pretty big response as far as I'm concerned so I'll give a little more info.  
I've never once regretted this relationship and never will because it did forge me into what I am now. I will always love this girl even though she's made it abundantly clear I mean nothing to her anymore but that's ok. The time we had together was wonderful, it helped me decide what I want to become and how to best do that. Saying it was a stepping stone to a better future wouldn't be far off but it wouldn't be respectful to her. Us breaking up was necessary for both of us so it isn't bad. She wasn't the waste of time, giving up all I did for her was the waste of time because in the end I was able to get most of my friends back but the lost experiences like going to parties and getting into trouble for things teenagers get into trouble for can't ever be relived, so that time was indeed wasted.

I should be listening to music on my drive to work, but instead, I find myself hoping against hope that today is the day that everybody gets their shit together and starts helping each other put the world together so that we can get somewhere as a group, but no. 

No.

 It never is.

 I cannot tell you how many times I have felt that hope die. How many times, I've felt it burn in my chest, wither and smoulder into ash. Each day it's reborn anew. I use the wiser, more mature side of myself to shelter that hope, as an adult would shelter a child, even though its pain is my pain. Even though I must comfort a piece of myself when it is discouraged by the strife and struggle and grief of the world. each morning I feel the same desire to know what is going on in the world and thinking "" Maybe today will be the day..."". It never is.

Messed about with it my entire life from a young age. I'm good at it but I fucking hate how stressed out it can make me from the impossible bug fixes to having to read up on an entire new API to accomplish something. Then there's the case of always not knowing quite enough to get something done which can usually be fun because you're learning something new but almost always it's important critical shit that jeopardises your entire code's security and shit.

Even though I've made some decent stuff over the years, the stress associated and the bullshit logical state of mind you get from coding for so long fucks you up more than it's worth. I get that this probably just a case of poor-form moderation. A little programming can probably do most some good but if you ever have kids, seriously.. letting them on the computer for too long will usually do more harm than good. I genuinely loved figuring everything out for myself, teaching myself how to code. Now I regret it all though, fucks my chances of using it for a job too because I'd fucking hate every second.

My Eating Disorder.

Spent a large proportion of my life obsessed with myself, how thin I was getting, how fat I was getting, what I could eat, what I hadn't eaten, what I was going to eat, what I had just eaten.

I barely have any friends from my past because I just upped sticks and left a number of times without telling anyone because I literally didn't think anyone gave a sh*t.

I spent days and nights hurting myself but on the outside I was happy, so of course most people didn't know anything was wrong. Then I get annoyed for most people not knowing anything was wrong (years later I realise that people were worried and didn't know what to do).

All those hours of my life over all those years that I wasted being desperately unhappy trying to reach a distorted goal that nobody really gives a flying f*ck about. My only goal was to be THIN, seriously?! It's such a ridiculous mental illness that I just hate it, nobody understands and most people congratulate you on not eating or being thin, or working out so hard.

I started recovery about 6 years ago, since then I have learned that I am lactose intolerant, coliac and now have IBS. My digestion is shot from the way I treated it all those years starving, binging and purging, chewing and spitting. I get easily injured because my connective tissue, bones, muscles...everything didn't develop properly. I am short because it all started when I was 12, I LITERALLY haven't grown one inch since I was 12. My teeth are destroyed and I have aged skin. I went from being bright, remarkably intelligent and focused to kind of average, my IQ substantially and measurably dropped over the first few years of my illness.

I believe in no life after death, I believe that we have this one remarkable, amazing, stunning, magical life. No do-overs, no re-sets. I fully live my life and try to explore, learn and love as much as I can. It is hard not to look back at 12 years of my life...nearly half of my life, that I spent in darkness, pain, self-harm and depression and see it was the biggest waste of time of my life, those precious days that I can't get back that I spent weighing myself or knocking myself out with pain killers because the urge to eat was so strong I knew I couldn't stop it if I was awake, all those friendships and relationships that stayed on the fringe of my psyche, never letting people in, all those days that I spent doing nothing but exercise in the fear of gaining 1lb of fat that I could have spent dancing, playing on the beach, walking through forests, trekking up mountains, rock climbing...discovering.

In the UK, you're required to do a foundation degree in order to progress on and do an art degree (unless you're reeeeaaallly good. Or unless you're a boy wanting to study fashion, because those courses are screaming for males.)

I didn't want to do a foundation because they say it's so you can experiment and pick a pathway, except I knew exactly what I wanted to do. So I opted for a ""Year 0"" which meant I would skip paying the higher fees as it was attached to the main degree course and I might learn some new skills. 

I learnt fuck all, apart from my way around the university and where to go out in town. It was easier than A level and incredibly boring. I spent the vast majority of my time wishing I was at home and working rather than wasting my time. 

I've since completed my first year of Costume and it was so SO much better. Lots of pressure and stress, but I've learnt so much new stuff.

She said yes, and I gave her a $50 necklace a few weeks later as an early birthday gift. 
We weren't able to spend a lot of time together when we first started dating, I went out West with my family the day after I gave her the necklace. 
We kept in touch while I was out there, and had said that she missed me and couldn't wait for me to get back. 
Apparently she forgot that she had a Facebook and uploaded pictures of the guys she slept with when I was gone. I hadn't found out about these pictures until one of my other friends had told me, for I didn't have an account at the time. 
So I came home, asked her if it was true, and she immediately said ""If you can't deal with my choices in life, you're not worth it!"" and walked away. Needless to say, I broke up with her, and haven't spoken to her since. A friend of mine who was buddies with the next guy she dated claimed that the she said that her current boyfriend gave her the necklace that I gave her.

,"Religion.  I have spent a lot of time trying to get the faithful to realize how  distorted their reality is and to see the bigger picture, but the more people you meet, the more you realize that the average person is not educated enough to grasp that bigger picture.  Thus, they succumb to logical fallacies and charlatans, and don't understand the science behind things (physics, astronomy, genetics).  For example, if people knew the actual history behind the Pentateuch and later ""canon"", they wouldn't be so fast to accept them.

The Internet is full of people who have better education, or at least interest in learning, and generally much easier to explain things to.  But even then, there are entire clusters of religious with mental brick walls.  I'm not talking about any particular religion here, just the religious in general.

Recently I have resolved to let the religious have their ignorance and enjoy their fairy tales because there is no way to get through to them.  They don't want to know anything different.  They have their answers and it makes them comfortable.

I just realized that you can't do anything for a lot of these people, and they will never change those beliefs.  I have given up and moved on to other intellectual pursuits, but I regret trying for so long.

As my college days came to a close, I got certified in real estate (like I had wanted to for years), got a great job with one of the top firms in New York (I honestly believe not because I listed a little college credit at the bottom of my resume, but because I'm fearless when it comes to interacting with people, whomever they may be) and now co-run the leasing office of one of Brooklyn's top luxury rental buildings. 

Let it be known that I'm not saying you shouldn't go to college. An education is vital to succeed in this world, and I did in fact learn so much while in college that is still pertinent today. What I am saying, is that I'm growing tired of people's expectations that if you don't follow a cookie-cutter path through life, that you won't succeed. Invest in college when you're CLEARLY passionate over what you're studying. You'll know because your grades will be great, your attendance will be stellar and you'll be excited about what you're learning about.

Don't get me wrong I played LoL for about 3 years and spent quite a few bucks on and and played Dota 2 since last year and also spent quite a bit of money. The 50/50 gamble you take when you play games though is beyond heartbreaking. Staying in games for 45 mins- 1 hour, and then just losing just makes you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty spoon dipped in superglue and coated with salt. I love(d) both games but the time you have to sink into them is killer. 

I have about 1500 games played on LoL and 450 hours clocked on Dota 2.

EDIT: If I had to pick 2 other choices it would be Runescape, which was the first online multiplayer game I played. Played close to 3 years, and probably the best social experience I've had in an online game ever. After that it would be World of Warcraft.

We would go to every party we were invited to together and even when we weren't partying, we were still getting a coffee really late at night or smoking a joint. I started post-secondary education a few months before he did so we were still hanging out on a regular basis since he had nothing else to do besides work. Then he got accepted into a college and that's when stuff went downhill. 

He started to become really cynical, contradicting, manipulative and would begin to explode out of anger towards me without any reason. I couldn't believe that he was becoming such a horrible person until I put the pieces together and realized he was being stressed out by school. That's when the fights between him and I started happening. They came out of nowhere with no reason (again) and I tried talking to him about what was going on. 

After we talked things out I thought we cleared the air really well, but then the same old shit started to happen again. By then, I was pissed at him rather than being sympathetic since I was so tired of dealing with his shit. Especially when I thought everything was good. Anyways, I wish I could say I cut him out of my life completely but the ramifications of doing that in our friend group(s) would change things drastically between everybody who we are friends with. 

However, what I am doing is keeping my space from him but it hurts to see a great friendship that basically turned into a joke of one. The one thing that makes this even worse is that he's started to talk shit about me. Sigh.",1fkqsb

Aside from that, it's the same as the top comment - worrying about what other people think of me, both in general and specifically in regard to feeling mostly subconsciously like I was supposed to follow a certain track in life and everybody would look down on me if I didn't. 

I kind of got free from it by accident and now I look back and wish I had known to look for other options sooner. By starting my own business I got promoted from struggling ladder climber to CEO overnight. But really it was less like that and more like just stepping out of that framework and into something where it wasn't relevant.

vereonix,"Secondary School (High school I think for US, ages 13-16/17), what a waste of time, geography, drama, algebra, music, religious studies, sure I learnt stuff there, but none of it has had any use in my life so far. I've learnt far more from just browsing the internet and reading articles.  

I'm now at University studying Programming, web design, photoshop etc, none of which was ever slightly touched at school.

People say its nice to have a broad spectrum of subjects at that age to get a taste of, no, from the get go I knew I was not going to be an actor, a chef, a musician etc. Yet we were forced to do those lessons. Oh but then we got GCSEs and we could narrow it down to 3/4 subjects (ofc we still had to do Maths English and Science and PE(fuck PE)) but now we have 3 subjects. There weren't 3 I wanted, this was meant to be where you specified in something, but still a waste of time.

This is so annoying for me, you could learn so much more advanced things if you could specify earlier on in life. I've had to wait until Uni before I could focus in on what I actually wanted to do, and even now they throw in stupid shit like databases and tbh even the photoshopping is kinda annoying as it isn't programming (I get that they're related, but i'd rather get really good on the base programming so applying it things like databases etc would be easier).

Slutbagger,"School, now that kinda sounds like bullshit, but I'll explain why: I have been ""alternatively"" schooled almost my entire life. I'm currently at the ass-end of 9th grade, and it is my second year of public school, my first being 7th grade. I was home schooled after kindergarten or first grade, I don't remember very well, but that was for a couple of years, in second grade I went to a school for home-schooled people where they offered electives and core classes and you could sort of pick your own schedule, I did that for one year, in 3rd grade I went to an alternative school similar to public school, except there was no homework and we spent a lot of time focusing on science, I don't remember doing a single page of math or anything like that. From fourth through sixth grade I went to a school where there were no real teachers or classes, the entire day was whatever you wanted to do and usually that meant computer or xbox games, I didn't study a single thing I didn't want to in those years. All I really learnt about was cars, computers, and weightlifting. These days I avidly pursue my passion in the human body, weight training, and rebuilding cars. 

Enough background though.

Entering 7th grade was sort of a hellish experience for me, after going to a school of ~60 people for the biggest portion of my life I remembered, I wasn't used to the roughly 750 people at my school or how they interacted with each other, and I experienced actual drama, it was awful for me, but I wasn't really ""that weird kid"" I had better social skills than almost all of them and was surprised at how immature people there were, not only socially, but also in terms of their knowledge, without any prior experience with the core classes I could pull a 3.7-4.0 GPA. In 8th grade, back to my alt school, but now I'm in 9th grade and still, without learning almost anything that's considered what people should know, getting between 3.5 and 4.0 GPA. 

Bottom line is, public school is a waste of fucking time, if I had the option of not going I would snatch it up, I love social interaction and I have a lot of friends, but I would leave that to go to a school that allows me to learn what I want. If people considered this as an option more often it would be beneficial to our society's youth. Public school is not for everyone, there are quite a few people not able to get high grades, and its not because they don't try. Furthermore, what you're taught in one grade is not applicable to the next, you don't build off information learned previously, you just learn a clusterfuck of different things that seem to not tie together whatsoever. 

TL;DR the most mature and least ignorant people I've met in my entire life exist in schools that are shunned by your average parent, school should be about learning what you want to pursue, as opposed to forcing everyone through a bunch of bullshit classes people are just going to learn for the year and forget later in life.

""Lifetime job placement assistance"" the ""Job placement"" center gives you a news paper jobs section and says ""Have you checked these job websites... You should check Craigslist, have you checked here?""  

That's not job fucking placement That's just sad.... 

Also, right before graduating (After all my time and money was vested) They gave us a ""Instructor"" who had spent years working for Intel (OHHHHHH MY!) Well, all he did was tell stories about Intel for months on end and despite our constant ""What about the curriculum"" rantings to him and the entire management of the ""educational company"" the guy finally says ""Okay, the final is in 2 days.. read the first 6 chapters of the book and be ready""

I had a friend back in middle school.  We hung out all the time, played video games.  He got me really into gaming actually.

High school comes around.  Different friend.  We both go off to school and come back after failing our first year at university. We hung out a lot because we were both fuck-ups at the time and had no clue what to do with our lives.  He starts drinking a bit more and more, and I realize that I want to actually do something with my life.  

So I hang out with him one less time than I usually would, then two, then three, etc etc.  Until we go months without seeing each other.  We don't even talk anymore.  He came through my line a few months back where I work and he's like ""Dude, hit me up sometime, we gotta chill"" and I realized, that I don't really have any interest in seeing this person because we just went in different directions.

684692,"I've wasted a lot of time in my life, but this is the only one that really bothers me.  The rest I was at least enjoying.  I had a period of four years where I worked for my mom's doomed small business, and then I needed to find a proper job when she closed it down.

So there I am, 19, and my resume is that I worked for an amusement park when I was 14 for a summer, and then my only other reference is my mom.  I despised anything that involved dealing with customers, partly because I didn't want to be seen by anybody I knew from high school.  I had no real skills beyond typing and for whatever reason, data entry was surprisingly hard to get into then.  So naturally I was almost unhirable for all the jobs I was applying for, not counting scam jobs that are all over the newspaper.  (Screw you, Kirby and Vector Marketing specifically.)

The worst one though, the one that broke me down and actually depressed me for some time, was Target.  Again, I hate retail, but I really needed a job and I had been throwing my sad excuse of a resume around for ages to no avail, and I figured stocking shelves overnight wouldn't be so bad.  I fill out Target's little digital application thing in the store, and somebody comes to me and tells me to wait at that kiosk for somebody to come get me for an interview.

*Three* hours later, a different person comes up and asks me why I'm still there.  I explained that nobody ever interviewed me, and he said he'd get somebody to see me right away.  An hour after that I finally get the interview I was asking for, I didn't complain to them about the wait, I didn't show anger to them.  If anything, I was excited.  I figured I'd get a pity-hire for the crazy wait, I mean the qualifications for stocking shelves can't be too high.  I went through the interview, felt like I did well enough, and left feeling somewhat upset about spending about three hours longer at this place than I expected, but otherwise okay.

Then I got the rejection letter and first there was the anger, then there was the depression.",1fkqsb

ripshit_on_ham,"Well, I enjoyed my time in WoW. But I will say that the raiding aspect definitely lines up with the worst wastes of time in my life because we were unrealistic.

I mean, I waste a lot of time. I am a huge gamer overall (console, PC, card, whatever), but never have I felt that so much of my time was absorbed for absolutely fucking NOTHING.

It was right after the first expansion had come out (The Burning Crusade for those not in the loop) and our guild essentially sucked before it came out (we could do Molten Core and Zul Gurub, but that was about it). I dunno why we thought our guild would be better with new content, but I guess we just assumed that since it was a fresh start it'd be easier if we were all in it together.

As it turns out, we just sucked. But the drive to push forward didn't change! So there we were on a brand new server, beating out heads against the wall for MONTHS on the same boss (Gruul). Every other night, we were online at 6:30pm and raided until about midnight. Every other moment of the day was spent gather materials to support said raids.

I went to work, I got home, jammed pizza into my face (because it was the only thing fast enough to eat and be able to make raid time). And every night we failed. Or even worse, we'd do a little better and that would put the fire back in peoples' bellies.

Eventually, we even beat that stupid boss, but it took FOREVER and we never made it past the 3nd boss in Serpentshrine Cavern.

It was a waste of time because we weren't raiders! We just kept pushing at it as if we were hardcore raiders, but we didn't have the leadership or attention span to really do it.

,"This, only Runescape. But I didn't waste my time. 

2007 was the best year of my entire life. All I did that entire summer was sit on my computer in my room and play Runescape.

I gained confidence that people I talk to in person would enjoy my company just like my friends on Runescape did. I was correct. 

I fell in love for the first time. The situation that allowed that to happen is since I was on the computer all day, I was on AIM all day and we talked every second through the entire summer, each playing our respective games. 

I was happy. I didn't need anything more in my life, I was satisfied with the amount of social activity through my game.

* One could always be doing something more fun, more stimulating, or more fulfilling 

* To burden oneself with the previous notion is the true waste of time, thinking about thinking often ties ones brain in knots

* It's important to feel fufilled and act out what your brain really wants (i.e. get off Reddit and read/take a walk), which takes a certain amount of discipline

* But, returning to point one, one should not try to grasp at having the most  fun, happiness or excitement (since there is nothing to grasp there), but rather strive to live in this moment (which is ongoing) as fully as one can

* Then one concludes there is neither wasted time, nor, no time to waste

I didn't.  I can say looking back now many years later, that I truly loved him. I had relationships afterward, where I thought I was in love, but then my mind would flash memories of my time with him, and knew it wasn't the same thing. I actually thought there was something wrong with me, that I was incapable of feeling that way again.

It wasn't until I met my current guy ten years later that I realized, ""this is it.  This is it again, this is what love is supposed to be.""  Not just the butterflies, and passion, but the deep care you feel for someone, and the way their happiness means your happiness, and the way it's not just ""you and him"" but rather, ""us"" and your life together, as a unit, rather than a life you happen to live alongside someone else's.  

If I hadn't had those years with him, I wouldn't have realized that it would have been a mistake to stay with those other guys just because it worked well, and we got along, they were nice guys, and because the pressure to settle down was rising.

Don't regret it.

We broke up several times during college and always got back together. I finally broke up with her for real a couple days before we graduated. I couldn't take it anymore.

,"I just watched the movie series, as I like seeing what kind of stories get teens worked up (and gets them to read!) and what people are emotionally bonding to. I understand the appeal and did feel for it, though my favorites tended to be side characters who had very few film lines. 

In general, all the aspects I appreciated most are rarely talked about-- the small town feel of Forks, the native-american reservation tensions, and some of the 'family loyalty-verus-personal desire' dilemma, and the big questions all vampire tales bring up (is immortality a godsend or a road to depression, what kind of love there after youth/beauty fades for only one of you, how do you connect to people if they'll just end up dying on you, the ethics of killing for food, etc)

Anyway, I went to the books (pdf's lol)to see if there was more pages/backstory on characters I liked (Garret/Kate, the wolf-dude's extended family drama, the hilarious Transylvanian vampires, Carlyle as head-of-family, that Egyptian vampire with the protective dad)

I combed through the books, reading chapters here and there. Even ignoring writing basics, these books are *very* poor amateur-level work in comparison to other YA stuff. I'd say the author's biggest flaw is just that she rambles and allows her characters to over-discuss before any decision/plot-move, in a way that undermines the best parts of their personalities and story-momentum. Soo many pages. Reading the screenplays, which give you the same characters through incredible economy of words is a breath of fresh air. 

As far as blockbusters go the twilight movies deserve Best Adapted Screenplay as far as I'm concerned. Those writers captured each character's potential while taking out all the noise, and also added some action to make up for Meyer's dull plotting/momentum mistakes. 

My takeaway from all this was that young readers will forgive basically Anything if the characters are strong enough to really connect with and long for on some gut narrative level.  I think her story does that pretty well. ",1fkqsb

Sadly I wish he would of finished Lost because it would of been much better. I truly thought it was a great show while he was there even though JJ Abrahams might have ruined all of TV since. Most shows follow his philosphy now. 1) have te viewers asking lots of questions 2) answer none of those questions 3) make them ask more questions 4) repeat until the season finale where everything becomes anticlimactic. The catch is the making the viewers think questions will get answered. Kurt Sutter is great at this as well, anyone who watches sons of anarchy knows what I'm talking about.

Eventually I no longer gave any fucks and used the time to have Pokémon battles with other people who weren't listening.

Not to mention the mandatory Bible classes you had to take every year, the mandatory 15 (later 25) Bible verses you had to memorize and recite to whomever once a semester, and the general holier-than-thou attitudes of 75% of the entire school. Hypocrites, all of them.

Was also forced to go to church and youth group until 8th grade. Nothing bores you to sleep quite like an Episcopalian sermon. When 8th grade came around my parents no longer made me go, and I haven't set foot in a church since other than the odd funeral.

If I learned anything from all of this, it was that if a god or gods do exist, they're not at all benevolent. They're assholes for letting so much horrible shit happen in the world.

For too many kids have the ""I don't know what I want to do, so I'll just enrol myself in a BSc or BA degree and figure it out later..."".  This is a dead end.  This is why so many people are graduating with a generic Bachelor's degree and can't find any jobs.  A Bachelor of Science/art/humanities is pretty much the bare minimum these days.  You are applying for a job with a degree that every other job applicant also has.  There is nothing there that stands you apart.

Choose a career path NOW, before you start school.  Customize your university/college education to fit this.  Most of the time, there are specific degrees/schools that primarily train students for specific careers.  Want to be a nurse? Engineer? Tradesman? Dental assistant? Unit clerk? Technician?  There are programs for each of those, and graduates have a much higher chance of finding work.

Change your mind?  That's ok, lots of people do.  However, finish your degree...  Get a job in that career, at least for a little while.  This way you have a support structure to live off of while you try and figure out what you REALLY want to do.  Who knows, you may like it anyways...",1fkqsb

I'm finally at the point (I'm 30) where I'm probably severing ties with my father. He's arrogant, self-important, refuses to take any responsibility for anything, has an alarming sense of entitlement, and never, never, never does anything that isn't fueled by his need to alleviate his own bad feelings. Everything he does is out of guilt or a need to ignore that he's made bad choices. My parents have been apart for twenty years and he still brings up my mother and accuses her of ruining his life, even to this day, and they have nearly zero contact (my children are the only reason they have any at all). He's an emotional terrorist that inundates me with texts and calls and Facebook messages designed to make me feel like I am at fault for his shitty life, and for not helping. And all this despite the fact that I have loaned him money, and continue to offer to loan him money, even though he makes no effort to repay it, and then goes and blows his own pay on concerts and camping trips and the tons of junk food that he refuses to see clearly causes his weight and diabetic issues (several doctors have told him as much). And whose fault is all this? Mine, my mother's, his siblings', the world's, the government's. Hell, it must have been our fault you didn't pay your taxes as an entrepreneur, too, huh? Must have been your kids fault that they expected you to pick them up for your legally granted custody visits, huh? Man, what a bunch of jerks everyone but you is.

Sorry for the rant. I wish I could say it made me feel better, but I would have to write a fucking book about that guy to feel relief. Just bringing it up puts my stomach in knots.

SonnoMaku,"tl;dr: finding jobs man...

I doubt my story is as bad as yours but here goes. I'm 19 almost 20 and I have been applying places trying to get a job and the only places I got a call back from was Hardee's and Walmart so far. Let's start with Walmart. I missed the call by 5 minutes because I was taking a shit. When I came back to my phone making a noise because there was a message I almost shit again. I called back and asked to speak with the woman who called me. I was told that she had left for the day. It was around 5pm so I figured that was when she got off work. I was kinda pissed she called 5 minutes before she got off but whatever. 

I called back the next day and was told she would be in a meeting all day so I left my name and was told she would call tomorrow. Tomorrow rolls around and I call at 10am. I finally got a hold of her and introduced myself and she told me she was sorry she would call me back later because the computers were offline at the moment. I said okay and waited until 5pm with no calls. The next day comes and I call at the same time and got her again. I finished telling her who I was and she immediately told me that she didn't have the time for me right now and that she would call me back later that day. I said okay thanks and she said uh huh and hung up. I never got a call. I was pissed after calling all week trying to talk to her and set up an interview for a fucking stocking position. I checked all possible stocking positions and listed that I was available for all hours but because their HR woman was a lazy asshole I couldn't get the interview set up. I called her for 8 days before I got fed up with her bullshit excuses and decided to focus on the other jobs I applied for.

Now for Hardee's. I applied to Hardee's and didn't get a call until a month or so later. I completely forgot I even applied so of course I was happy. I went in for the interview and was told to sit down and given a drink. So I went and sat down for 30 minutes drinking this soda they gave me. Finally the person comes out and says hello and tells me to come over to another table with him. However he was actually saying that to me and this other guy that was apparently there for the same thing. This was apparently a double interview. 

The guy interviewing us was constantly reminding us how this was a pretty informal interview and he just wanted to talk with us and tell us about the job. The whole time he was asking questions to me I would answer and the other guy would 1-up me by saying whatever I said but something better. Like I said that I had my own car and lived on the other side of town then he said that he lived a 5 minute walk from the place. Things like that. At the end of the interview the interviewer said that we would most likely get the job and to go home and wait for a call. The other guy got up after that and walked out but I stood up and shook the interviewers hand and said thanks for the interview then left. I thought fuck that 1-uping other guy I bet I look a hell of a lot better now then he does since he just got up, said nothing and left. 

Well fast forward to 2 weeks later and I finally get a call from them. It was a different guy asking me to come in for an interview and I told him that I already had and I thought this was the call telling me that I was hired. He said oh and asked for the guys name that interviewed me. I gave it to him and he said that he would go and ask him about my interview then call me back. I thanked him and hung up. A few days and no call later I find out from a friend that the guy who originally interviewed me and a ton of other people got fired in a mass firing of people from Hardee's and that was why I got called in for another interview. Instead of the guy telling me that he just bullshitted me and never called back.

I am still currently looking for a job and fucking depressed. :/ I guess I need to start going in and bugging the shit out of people even though I've heard mixed opinions about going in as opposed to just calling. Also I have a friend that recently got a job. He put in the application got the call within the week and was working there by the next week. How the fuck does that shit happen but I keep getting all this bullshit? I just don't know... Also the same friend hasn't even worked there a month and he is going to do some boy scout camp thing over the summer and got the okay to do it then come back and work the job he just got.

Why the fuck can't I get a job? O.o

For me at least, some of the things that happen to me that I would call anxiety:

* Extremely irrational worrying, for extended periods of time. ""If I don't do X, then Y will happen"" regardless of how likely things are to happen, I will focus on the negative possibilities obsessively. 

* Impaired decision making abilities, when facing certain issues I will worry so much that I will not be able to make decisions relating to the issue, as i will get anxious about making mistakes, that getting something wrong might make things worse. This can mean that the issue itself becomes more troublesome than it would have been if I had the ability to make rational decisions without anxiety taking over.
* Fear of people, of being judged for my behavior and condition. If suffering from a lot of anxiety I will find it extremely difficult to go outside, or anywhere with large numbers of people. Going to the shops becomes some kind of dramatic, adrenaline challenge, where traffic becomes an ominous danger, the people in the street are obstacles to avoid at all cost, eye contact is asking for a death-glare... lots of irrational fears come out to play.
* Fear of confrontation, anything that resembles an argument becomes a terrifying battle. Reading messages from people who I have not been able to talk to cause me to freak out. If people try and press issues aggressively it can cause strong fight or flight responses, sometimes trigger panic attacks that can lead to uncontrolled movement or locking position. Tends to be weaker if I am with other people, the panic attacks do not get a chance to grow.

Anxiety issues can feed into other things, such as depression and low self-esteem. I can be having a great day, then something raises my anxiety, the anxiety might pass, but I will be left with other issues that need to be resolved before I am back to where I started.

TLDR: for me, anxiety = irrational, uncontrollable fear

,"Yes you can help having thoughts like that.

it's not a different phenomenon that's unique to you, you're just like everybody else with those thoughts. It's insecurity and an unstable self image.

You are actually going to go out of your way and spend precious time and energy to make me feel bad? Fuck off, what positive lesson comes from that? Besides the fact that I now know you are a bitch/asshole.

 I have found that people that tend to act this way are miserable themselves and get some sense of comfort knowing everyone else around them feels the same way. In which case I can take the overall negative situation and take a positive from it, that being, at least I am much more content with my life then they are.

,"\>Implying people who don't worry about what other's think about them are sociopaths

Yeah, sure. A sociopath will care what others think of them to the point that they will manipulate what they think of them for their own gain. 

Giving undue attention to what people think of you is, as parent said, a waste of time. A mentally healthy individual will take others' opinions into account, but not get caught up in conforming to them. Doing so is a great way to become depressed.

It sounds like you're just saying that not caring what others' think of you is a symptom of sociopathy to make yourself feel better about the importance you give to others' opinions.",1fkqsb

willidinho,"Well there isn't a lot of work out there for attorneys, at least not interesting or decently paid work. I enjoy learning and debate and genuinely thought I would get a chance to do both at law school...in reality, law school is just a three year interview process for big firms to figure out which students they can get to work the most hours...",1fkqsb
willidinho,"Well I went to law school straight after finishing my bachelor's degree, which is the worst way to do it. I approached law school like I had approached the rest of my education, I had an interest in several aspects that I associated with being a lawyer (debate, negotiation, researching interesting things...) and I thought it would be a good place to explore those interests, meet new people, learn new things, expand my understanding of the world, and I could figure out what to do with this new education later on. Unfortunately, law school is not a place to explore your interests or meet cool people, and you definitely shouldn't be waiting to figure out what you want to do with your law degree until you get to law school. In reality, law school is a 3 year interview.

The not-so-secret reality of the legal profession is that law school graduates don't generally get paid that well. Most graduates can hope to make around $50k a year, some graduates will work in public interest fields or as clerks making less that $50k, and a tiny portion will get super-high salary jobs at big law firms (though you will be expected to work 100+ hours at these big firms for at least the first 5 or so years to make sure you stay on the ""partner track"", so when you do the math, $200,000 for working 100+ hours a week with almost no time off, its $50/hr or less). But law schools like to tell prospective students that their average graduate makes around $100k, so they need to push as many students towards the big firms as possible. So law school becomes a feeder program for these big firms, the idea is to reward the students that take on the biggest workload while achieving high grades. They don't care what you research or write about on law journal, they just want to know that besides busting your ass to do all your assigned reading, working at least one internship, running for secretary or whatever of whatever stupid club (preferably 3-4 clubs), brown-nosing all your profs, and attending ""networking events"", you are also busting out a few researched articles or at least editing some published works. It's not about what you are doing, but how much of it you are doing. That's what the legal profession is, 90% of the work is extremely simple, its just a matter of doing a lot of it, making it seem complicated, and convincing your client to pay you as much as possible for this work.  

One other thing they want is competition. Competitive employees are willing to work longer and harder to make sure they look better than the next guy, lawyers have to compete to get business, and the law itself is necessarily competitive in nature. Law schools help nurture this competition. If you go to a tier 1 school, the ABA requires that in a class of 18 or more (might be 15, don't really remember) the average grade for the class must be a B or lower. Supposedly, this is to fight grade inflation, but what it does is to create more competition among law students - you now benefit from your fellow classmates getting worse grades and will be hurt by them doing better. There are stories abound in law school about students giving each other false information or hiding/destroying books in the law library. So, in addition to the attraction of anti-social Type-A personalities to law school, you have now given everyone an incentive to hate each other. You compete for grades, you compete for journal spots, you compete for internships, you compete for everything. It's a hard place to meet cool people. I was lucky in that I found a solid group of about 10 people that I really enjoyed hanging out with, 3 years out of law school, I even keep in touch with a few of them. 

If you plan on going to law school, you should know before you start exactly what job you want. Not ""I want to be a defense attorney"" or ""I want to work in international law"", you need to find a SPECIFIC job - ""I want to be a patent attorney at XYZ Law Firm"" or ""I want to be in-house counsel at Pepsi"". Then talk to someone that has that job, find out how they got it, talk to the hiring manager/attorney there and find out what they look for, and then go to law school to get those exact qualifications, ignore everything else and just do the things that will help you achieve that position. 

Then, once you graduate, realize you are qualified for exactly nothing. Start trying to find a job that will train you and start studying for the bar exam. ",1fkqsb

I grew up always knowing that I'd go on a mission, it's a pretty big expectation of mormon youth. 

From LDS.org 
""After His Resurrection, the Lord commanded His disciples to ”go . . . and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost“ (Matthew 28:19). In fulfillment of this command, able young men in the Church have a duty to prepare spiritually, physically, and emotionally to serve as full-time missionaries. Single women and mature couples also have the opportunity to serve full-time missions.""

It's a game that is balanced almost solely on the gear you have. The BEST players in the world can not beat a challenge that mediocre players can if their gear is 360 instead of 410. 

It's a mind-numbing, boring piece of shit game finely-tuned to get you to waste as much time as possible.

You got:

1. Bullshit useless achievements piled on
2. Bullshit useless titles that take forever to get
3. Bullshit useless mounts that take forever to grind
4. Absolutely necessary gear which takes forever to grind 
5. Repetitive quests which take forever to complete and follow the same scheme from level 1-90

It's just a big load of shit. They take away all the skill, all the independence, and instead make it a game about wasting time. And at the highest levels of play, it is about gear AND following an optimized rotation of actions for a long-ass time. No room for improvisation, no room for improvement. Victory or loss in top raids are almost a mathematical affair.

Best advice i can give is try force yourself into a somewhat normal pattern of sleep. Have a shower, clean yourself properly, and get dressed, even if you're not doing anything. It's something small, and i know how hard it is (which sounds really stupid, but it's fucking hard), but its a start, try do small things. Society expects us to be normal, but to someone with mental illness, ""normality"" is THE hardest thing. 

Do the small things, pet your dog/cat, watch something engaging, cook yourself something nice, something that requires at least a little effort. Routine is the ""easiest"" thing to do, changing attitudes, thinking patterns, self esteem etc etc is the hardest.",1fkqsb

Hats_are_nice,"Hey I'm coming out of 2-3 year long anxiety and panic attack issues. I would have panic attacks every day. Here's what helped me stop having them.  

1. breath meditation. I'm not religious but daily meditation (30 mins.) has been shown to reduce anxiety and also thicken gray matter in your brain to make you less susceptible to mental illness. This has helped me the most.  

2. You probably have repressed emotions because you feel that you have to act a certain way around people. You MUST let these emotions go through you instead of trying to think your way out of them (what causes panic attacks.) So basically next time you feel anxious around people allow yourself to feel these emotions even if it means being emotional around people.   

My anxiety was the fear of expressing emotion around people so I would bottle them up. You can't bottle up emotions you have to feel them and allow yourself to look angry. If you do bottle up emotions they will only come back stronger.",1fkqsb

You'll hear the typical complaint that it's a game of ""kill 10 boars"" and grinding, but it's really not, especially in its current state. Many of the game's quests have been redone, and a lot of them are a lot more engaging and exciting. They've added a ton of features to have fun with, and combat is quick and exciting.

While I personally love Vanilla WoW (or, original WoW) more than current WoW, it's still an utterly fantastic game with a ton to offer, and even though it might look a bit pricey to get all the expansions, if you end up liking it the game is a LOT of bang for your buck. 

You can play for free up to level 20. I say give it a try, and recommend you find a friend to join you, as the game is made to be played with other people (or just fine a cool guild in game!).",1fkqsb
,[deleted],1fkqsb
TheMentalist10,"Go for it. Despite all the people reminiscing about how good Vanilla was, the game has never actually been better than the content available in the latest expansion. 

Vanilla was more *special*, but people forget that it was just grinding punctuated by the occasional hour-long run to a dungeon. The game now is in a healthier state than it ever has been; questing, for example, is more streamlined, more involved and makes more sense. I recommend it :)",1fkqsb

Matrillik,"I'll never understand the large amount of haters on reddit for WoW. The game is constantly evolving to make the game more fun. Blizzard does this by trying their hardest to cater to every part of their playerbase. Whether you are a casual leveler, casual raider, hardcore endgame raider, or diehard pvper, they are constantly tweaking everything in game to make it run more smoothly. WoW is basically just the end result that every other MMO is shooting for. I don't play anymore, but I still recommend the game to people who like highly immersive MMOs.

People just hate on it because they are elitist assholes who think that a game is only fun if you devote countless hours to getting better and there are ridiculous grinds that give you small rewards that let you stroke your epeen, not to say WoW doesn't currently have those.

You really have nothing to lose by trying, since it is now free up to level 20.",1fkqsb

Raiding was fun during the original game (40 man raids like Molten Core or Onyxia). It seemed like the strategy for them was involved, but not overly difficult. It was also POSSIBLE to not be 110% perfect in all of your movements. There was a little wiggle room for error.

Apparently my guild had difficult time with encounters that requires specific placement and the leadership had a hard time corralling people. 

So to answer your question, no...once it got to The Burning Crusade it wasn't fun to struggle every single night with hardly any progress. It WAS fun to down bosses, but because our guild wasn't good enough to be a real raiding group, we had no right to push as hard as we did to beat these encounters.

If I could change how I handled it, I would have still raided when I could, but I wouldn't have sacrificed as much time as I did in a guild that couldn't actually do it.

I would just be in a casual guild that did nothing, but raided the encounters later on when they were nerfed or sub-level.

zeg1948,"*This is really long and rambly, but the ""sin"" assumption always bugs me. I guess the wicked really* do *take the truth to be hard.* :-) 

I didn't feel that it was all a waste of time when I did believe; I had many worthwhile experiences, including on my mission. I also had a few bad experiences, and made some bad decisions that I could, if I felt so inclined, conceivably blame on Mormon teachings and social pressures. I can't help but think that some parts of my life would have turned out much better if I had managed to let go of Mormonism earlier. 

When I said that I was interested in sex, I didn't say I was having any.  Nor was I watching R-rated movies or drinking Coca-Cola when I came to the conclusion that religions, including Mormonism, were not supported by sufficient evidence or compelling arguments.

I think that many Mormons feel that they _are_ doing their best to ""keep the commandments"" when they struggle to receive guidance, confirmation, or other ""blessings"" that they seek. And the automatic assumption of many coreligionists is that these people must be sinning. Or praying without sufficient faith, or without ""real intent."" Many Mormons will uncharitably reject any protestations to the contrary. I can understand why Mormons sometimes think this way; it's a ready-made, unfalsifiable argument that dismisses any doubts. No critical thought or uncomfortable questioning of God's works or will is required. It's impossible to prove to someone else that you really tried your hardest, or to convince them that you're not secretly sinning. While I don't doubt that lots of Mormons sincerely believe that this is a good explanation, and even employ it without any ill-will, it still seems like an unreasonable, automatic reaction that cannot be supported without presupposing the argument's legitimacy.

So why _did_ I feel guilty? Maybe I took Jesus too seriously when he seemed to imply having sexual thoughts should be compared to **cheating on your wife.** (Some people, perhaps non-Mormon ones, might question this exegesis of Matthew 5:28, e.g. they think he was talking about *coveting* your neighbor's wife, and the verse isn't necessarily about sexual desire generally, but I think plenty of Mormons interpret the verse in the way I've described.) Maybe I also felt guilty because of (what I perceive to be) a deeply legalistic, guilt-oriented religious upbringing. (Also, it wasn't even all about sex; there are **PLENTY** sins of omission and commission to feel bad about in Mormondom.) If you don't think the LDS church is legalistic, I'm not sure you've ever tried reading *For the Strength of Youth* from an outside perspective. (And what's up with 'no beards anymore'? That ain't right. I might think Brigham Young was a real jerk, but that beard was awesome.)

_True to the Faith_ says (page 30):
>Those who engage in sexual ""immorality"" [scare quotes mine] often feel fear, guilt, and shame.

But there seems to be plenty of evidence that lots of good, decent, kindhearted people feel no such shame for engaging in sexual activities the Mormon church proscribes. When people do feel bad about sexual behavior, it's often because they've been told by trusted authority figures that they **should** feel very, very bad indeed (as in _The Miracle of Forgiveness_, which I'm very glad they tell missionaries not to read). I didn't leave the LDS church because I wanted to sin, but both before and after I did, I realized that some things Mormons call sins aren't. And some ideas that they teach (about sex, e.g.) really harm sincere, faithful believers (whether they're gay, victims of sexual abuse, or just teenagers whose genes *really* ***really*** want to be replicated). And I do realize that not all Mormons think exactly the same way on these topics. Local leaders vary in how they conduct interviews and church discipline, and GAs differ in how much they emphasize divine mercy or justice, or in which words they use, like when [Jeffrey Holland quoted from a letter where Joseph Smith said](http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god?lang=eng):
>[God] is more liberal in His views, and boundless in His mercies and blessings, than we are ready to believe or receive

Holland decided to skip the next part.
>and at the same time more terrible to the workers of iniquity, more awful in the executions of His punishments, and more ready to detect in every false way, than we are apt to suppose Him to be.

Well, what can we say. ""That which is wrong under one circumstance, may be, and often is, right under another"", though Nancy Rigdon seems to have disagreed.

Just to be clear, I'm not advocating some sort of libertine lifestyle where sexual passions overrule any restraint. I'll admit as quickly as anyone that sex can be harmful, and that self-control is a good thing. Sex can result in STDs. It can lead to unwanted pregnancies that can result in abortions, or kids growing up in awful environments. Some teenagers, who are emotionally still like children, have sex before they are emotionally ready. Families and individual's lives can be destroyed by affairs, or by sexual abuse. I don't think sex is all fun and games. But I also don't think that masturbation offends immortal beings, or leads to homosexuality (which I don't think is wrong), or that there is a man in the sky who watches our every move and gets upset when a boy and a girl have sex before they get married. I don't think there's a darn thing wrong with oral sex (which, to be fair, LDS Bishops aren't supposed to ask about anymore. I'm also glad that Mormons are officially more progressive on birth control than, say, Catholics).

Back to my original point: assuming sin as a reason for disagreement about religious doctrines is problematic, from a logical point of view, and it also seems to invite responses that question the believer's motives. You might think some people sour on Mormonism cause they don't like its sexual restrictions. They might respond that Mormons believe unreasonable things about sex and many other things because those beliefs are part of their identity. So, because Mormons don't like what they perceive as an attack on their community, their own image (as an intelligent, reasonable, good person, &c.), and even on their God, they (like other religious believers) try to remove their beliefs beyond a place where reason and evidence can ever hope to falsify them.

,"I'll give you the most honest answer I can because I get how complicated this can be, given the situation.

It's tough. I'm guessing you don't feel much for him emotionally; I'm pretty impartial to my Dad because he's not a person, but a problem to me. I'll tell you what all the therapists, psychiatrists, and counsellors have told me; the only person that can change them is themselves, and acknowledgement of what they've done to you or how they've acted doesn't mean that they're going to change at all. Even if some of what you're seeing is positive, the behaviour, on the most part, is still going to happen.

On the other hand it may benefit you to keep the relationship open and amicable, especially if you have a degree of separation in that you live on your own. I'm pretty sure that I'd be relatively fine with my Dad if I didn't depend on him to be a productive member of the household. I'm not sure if your Father is as stupid as mine though, because mine would literally not know the difference and would probably just figure that I was busy living my own life. As long as I was just really keeping up what amounts to a relationship of appearances, he'd be happier than a pig in shit.

It all boils down to if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is one. If you're going to keep a line of communication open, know what to expect and don't let yourself be disappointed, I guess. /hugs

but lol what do I know given the circumstances ;P I hope things work out for you. I really do. c:",1fkqsb
rawrr69,"I can relate in a way, look the only thing that really matters in such a situation is YOU and that YOU can live, prosper and be HAPPY. Literally nothing else matters. It doesn't matter whether you should care for him or not, doesn't matter whether he deserves it or not. Completely free your mind of ANY concern for anyone else but you. And then find a way that YOU can be happy and stable with the situation. If this means you can stop caring so much that he doesn't bother you or drag you down anymore, then good - if it means you move away to reach that status of happiness  and stability then just as good. The only thing that matters is that YOU make things right for **YOU** and not for anyone else.

That being said, chances are very good that moving out and as far away as humanly possible is a VERY good idea simply because that kind of space between you and the bullshit can already help a LOT and you can focus all your energy on other things and not trying to stay happy and stable in close proximity. If unsure, move the fuck out, break off contact... see how you feel in 6 to 12 months from that.


I have grown up in a very toxic environment and now I regret it more than anything that I never moved out and allowed this poison to corrupt me day after day after day... I think the first time I stood in front of my mother, shielding her from that asshole, I was maybe 4 or 5? I literally have not a single positive or loving memory of him, things were ALWAYS bad, every day I was more or less on edge and ready to jump, to jump at him and FINALLY beat him the fuck into the ground... for 10, 15, maybe 20 years. As far as I am concerned it would have been right and justified but in the end, that doesn't matter what would have been right or wrong, the only thing that matters is I did not come out on the other side of it all well and stable and whole now. But broken, caught up in past regrets and crushingly lonely, I am isolated from other people. I am fully convinced this environment has broken me beyond repair, for life. Others get to invest their energies in positive things, I would have to invest all my energy into trying to be whole and ""normal""... how unfair is that.

So, really, it does not matter what you do now, in a moment - the only thing that matters is the long run and in the long run, a stable environment for you is ALWAYS better than a shitty one. That's why you got to focus on finding your peace and happyness and stability.

Just look at Wowhead today, it's a google in itself and contains all the information you'd ever need.


World of Warcraft simply haven't grown fast enough to keep things new, recreate a World of Warcraft game that revolutionizes the gaming world just as WoW did and you'd experience those feelings again, however, since you know exactly how the world behaves, you don't get the feeling of how epic things are around you anymore.



Calling the newer expansions bad is simply not true, as someone who hardcore raided in TBC and WotLK a nd once again in MoP, the game is so much better on so many levels but since it's all figured out, it's not fun and challenging in the same way, It's still super hard yes, but it's challenging because it's hard to execute, not because the tactics are hard to figure out.


How many of you can honestly say you don't know the tactics for e.g. Illidan.

I found out at the very end of the Shivering Ilses(the thing  did last) that fast travelling was a thing. At first I was mad, but I quickly realized that the game would have been so much less if I had fast traveled.

The most ardous journies were when I had to go to Leyawiin for a quest. It was so far out of the way and it seemed like I never got good random events down either side of that river.

I was upset when I found out that Skyrim didn't have the Athletics or Acrobatics stat. At the end of that Oblivion character, I must have been doing 70 or 80 mph on foot. I know I was at least twice as fast as horses. Running from place to place was pretty efficient at that point.

I don't feel like I got any special skills that can really help me in the real world, and I put off school, and now I can't afford it.. I imagine I would have been able to finish it if I didn't go on the mission. 

I believe that as a mormon missionary, you're so entrenched in the doctrine that you don't really learn anything about the real world. You're still in your own little bubble, with your simplistic point of view. 

Before I left for my mission, I had lived with my parents my whole life and that included church activities every sunday and more. They really didn't give me time, or mental space to even think about other options. When I came home, I got married rather quickly, because that is what young men are told to do. VERY shortly into life on my own with my new wife, I figured out that I was doing everything for myself. There was no man guiding my life, and I felt no mystic power when I was supposed to. Not to mention always being creeped out by the mormon [temple ceremony] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6udew9axmdM). I was confused, and church was boring. I saw what other people were doing with their lives (living them) and I was jealous. 

So, as I was bored, the situations of other people, mainly third world countries came to my view. How could a loving heavenly father let that happen to all of those people? Why am I told to pray for help on a test or for god to help me find my car keys, when these people worry about finding a rat to eat, so they can survive for another night? I couldn't justify that to myself. ",1fkqsb

,"I don't think a mission is for everyone, but only in the sense that not everyone is ready to go on one. Your experience, oqw, is very similar to mine before I went. I didn't have a good amount of faith in the church, if any. But I did have faith that it will teach me to be a better person. It did teach me and became the largest period of self discovery I've had in my entire life. But the decision to go is really up to you. What you said, honestly, is a good reason. But Faith is going to be a question you have to answer. The core of a mission is acting (and becoming) like Christ, (and of course no one is successful, resulting in some of the ""colossal douche bags"" spicyflavor mentioned), and on a mission you get to try and do that 24/7. So of course you need to find out for yourself if becoming like Christ is a noble goal, and if the LDS church is the best organization to facilitate that.",1fkqsb
,Jeez go to an out of state college or even an in state one that is far enough away from home. If you don't believe in the church any more and just want to go to learn people skills and how to cook you're going to have a bad time.,1fkqsb
spicyflavor,"If you didn't have to have a companion, I'd say it would be worth it. If there weren't strict rules, that you get punished for (getting put with colossal douche bags) then, yeah. That's one thing I wanted to do though, get away from my pushy mormon family, and what better way to do it then have them pay for me to go on a mission? Haha. But after having done it, no. I would have rather moved to a different state with my girlfriend and lived in complete poverty until getting on my own two feet. 

It's not that cut and paste though, unfortunately. There's severing family/friend ties involved, in a lot of cases, complete social suicide. But hey, if you want to get away, there are better (in the long run) options. Get some job experience, go to school.. Something to put under your belt. ",1fkqsb

turbie,"He had developed depression and anxiety. This was before we were married and he was laid off. He spent a whole year holed up in my apartment mooching off of me being all depressed and feeling too much anxiety to find a job or go out with friends. It started before he was laid off, but it got worse during that time. 

I told him I could no longer afford to feed him, give him money, and his being at my place all day was raising my bills. So he decided to break up with me. During this time (6 weeks) he came to realize pot might be the problem so he quit, then asked to get back together. A month after he quit his anxiety eased enough for him to get a job, and a few months after that his depression became manageable. 

During the next year though he had bouts of anxiety and/or depression. Once he started working out regularly both went away. Then he added pot back in, and depression and anxiety came back and he quit his job. Then he realized it was the pot and quit for good. 

This was 7 years ago and every once in awhile he thinks he can handle pot again, only to find out he still can't. He most likely will not be able to ever smoke it again. Lucky for him I hate the way pot makes me feel so I have no desire to ever use it. ",1fkqsb

,"Eh for me it has, I've been having a blast on the private server. I understand that what I love about WoW is a lot different than what other people did. I never cared much about the gear treadmill, I was never the guy who freaked out about class balance, I didn't follow the optimal itemization guides or the perfect spec. I knew enough to be competent, but I never got obsessed with being the absolute best. Vanilla was a great big sandbox to play in, it felt like a big open world. Today, WoW is far bigger but feels so tiny when there are portals everywhere and you can fly across the map at 310% speed on giant rainbow fire dragons. They did so many quality of life additions to the game over the years that really added up and made the experience feel so superficial. Not to mention the streamlining and gutting of classes and professions to the point where everything is the same vague blah that doesn't really do anything differently from the other vague blahs.

I still think WoW is probably the best MMO ever made, but things like resilience, flying mounts, removal of talent trees, removal of crafting specializations, and similar such 'features' really did hamper the experience quite a bit. Flying mounts is probably the #1 thing though, if they ceased to exist I'd probably resub right now.

I have a degree pretty close to the ones you mentioned you wish you followed.  Contrary to common perception, we *do* help people and make a difference in their lives, and I would argue that we make a more substantial contribution to the population as a whole, in both productivity and financial senses.  However, it's more discretely measurable, and I'm largely unfamiliar with your line of work, so it's quite possible that I'm completely off.

Where we don't measure up is helping others in an emotional (and perhaps intellectual) sense.  I don't form strong emotional bonds with my customers.  My job is to help them do their jobs more efficiently, or to provide them with greater technological opportunities that they feel enhances their lives.  I am indeed helping people, but in a different sense.

Someone with a Masters in teaching Special Ed is going to have a large impact (but on a very small subset of the population.)  While I will never argue that there's no value in that, in the way our educational system is currently set up (I agree that this is an issue), you're setting yourself up for failure since your customers are already struggling.  While there is demand for people with your set of skills, the people who are paying for it aren't able or willing to give an amount commensurate with your level of training.

While I agree that your work is important, I'd much rather help people in a different way and be well-compensated for it because it provides them financial value.  Those are the customers most readily able and willing to pay for services.

Most of my friends work in IT or engineering, and only one had issues finding a job after college.  It took him a year, but he is now working in his field and being paid well for it.

I also have some friends who studied business, and all but one is doing well.  He can't seem to hold a job in the area, but he just got a new one.  I don't know him too well, so I don't know what the issue is.

My friends with degrees that end in ""of Arts"" have mixed results.  My college had a great photography program, and lots of them studied that.  Some are working in their field, but the vast majority or not.  My girlfriend studied French.  She's going back to school for her second degree in an ""of Science"" field.

I would argue that the most responsible way to determine your career path is to first look at fields that pay enough to cover the required training, and *then* find a subset of this list that would make you emotionally fulfilled, and pick something from there.  My girlfriend loves French, but that was a good $60,000 down the drain for something she could have picked up in her free time.  Why willingly put yourself in that position?",1fkqsb

I primarily work with young people with autism spectrum disorders. Usually lower functioning and even nonverbal, not the ones that go on to Intel or NASA. 

There are ways for me to leverage my specialty into higher incomes like opening a private autism practice and getting out of public ed. I need some more experience and specialized certification first but it's totally doable. My only problem with that is I would be going from serving everyone who needs it to just the rich who can afford private therapy for their autistic child. If I could gross enough, I could extend some goodwill ""scholarships"" to the needy, but that would ultimately be a pittance. 

I often think about going back to school for a CS or CIS degree, but I'm scared given the fact I just graduated and have several tens of thousands of dollars of student loans just to get where I am. 

Do you think it would be worth it to accrue more student loan debt in order to ""respec"" in a ""of science"" degree? 

Would a BA in one of those fields suffice to get my foot in fiscally rewarding work or do you pretty much need a grad degree at this point? 

Keep in mind that ""fiscally rewarding"" for me is with the perspective that I'll top out at about $63k annually *after* about 15 years on the job if I stay a teacher and don't go administration.

I'm not sure.  From your writing above the quoted line, it sounds like there's a valid and good strategy there.  It's a niche market within a niche market.  If you can break into it, then awesome for you.  I'm guessing it's networking that will get you to where you want to be, as I know you're competing with lots of highly-qualified people.  If you can make it work, and if it's something you're that passionate about, then go for it.

Depending on your area's cost of living, that salary is not bad.  You definitely deserve more for your specialized skills and training, but it's not like you'll be living in the slums.

In regards to CS/CIS, do you get summers off?  If you do, I would suggest that instead of paying money to go back to learn skills that will be out of date, that you use free time to contribute to open source projects on sourceforge or github.  From there, you'll be able to use that experience on your résumé.  That would be a decently safe backup plan.  Getting a job in the tech field will be easy (relative to the job hunt you've already made) with some practical experience under your belt.

Obviously it is *better* to not to be obese, for yourself, your family and  and for society in general.

Obesity is just one example of poor impulse control, if everyone sacrifices discipline for immediate gratification society would collapse. No one would work or pursue long term goals. Being able to delay pleasure and use discipline is part of being an adult. 
",1fkqsb
Metalheadzaid,"1. This doesn't matter and isn't conducive to shit. It's just you spewing words and assuming they're true.

2. Sure, it is. Health wise is is statistically better to be fit, but your other arguments are again, pure bullshit. You're just inserting your opinion again. THIS WAY IS BEST WAY. There's no statistical measurement there. Your family won't love you less.

3. I'm not arguing not to pursue long term goals at all. I'm arguing that people in these sorts of arguments like to avoid the fact that they too don't give enough of a fuck to pursue them. There's also the fact that people focus only tomorrow so much that they forget about today. The amount of fun medical students have for 30 years is incredibly low. Is it worth it? Most say no, they wouldn't do it again, but it's already too late. They missed out on so much life. I'm simply telling people to do what they *want* to do. If you're always doing what you want, you'll always be at peak happiness. Do you want to go get your degree? Then you will. Do you want to get fit? You will then. It's a god damn action you take. Obviously you don't care enough at this point, or you would go after it. People need to stop dwelling on the fact that they're 'wasting' their life and roll with it.",1fkqsb
,"Well I was about to reply before you ninja-edited your comment to be ruder...

1. It matters to *them*, which is why most try to lose weight to improve their sexual/dating opportunities. They obviously still have the same sexual urges as and are attracted to healthy people. It's not like they consciously decide that eating cake is preferable to having a nice body, it's just more rewarding in the moment than going to the gym.

2. Obviously it's better for your family not to be obese, they have to worry about your well-being and more often than not get saddled with the burden of your health care. It's better for society because obesity is an enormous strain on the economy and health care system.

3. Of course there will be hypocrites whatever the argument, this is really a marginal point.
I'm not saying we should forget about today, it's equally unrewarding to ignore the present completely. It doesn't have to be one extreme or the other, as in most things there needs to be a balance. Work hard, party hard.  

   I can't speak for medical students but I'm sure you don't either by saying they ""don't have any fun"" for the rest of their lives. I'm sure many doctors, nurses, surgeons find what they do rewarding on many levels.  

>I'm simply telling people to do what they want to do

People want conflicting things. I might want to get a degree but I might not want to study right now. Which ""want"" do I follow?



",1fkqsb
Metalheadzaid,"1. Obviously it doesn't. Or they would fix that problem. You seem to not get it. It's not about rewarding in the moment. People aren't mentally incapable of knowing time = reward. Cooking takes longer than ordering pizza. Yes, they did decide that eating cake is more preferable to having a nice body. Obviously, if given the choice, they'd take both, but they aren't. People like to act like there's some voodoo force in the universe that is affecting their decisions (most people call it 'addiction'). They, again, as most will NOT admit (you included), choose to do what they do.

2. Not all families care about them being obese, you just think they would. You seem to not get that your opinion isn't fact, as you keep making the same arguments over and over. Second, obesity is only a drain on society should the person be unable to fund themselves. As a whole, there are plenty of fat people who are costing us nothing different than others. The argument here IS viable though, as 2 broke ass people - one obese and one not - would cost the tax payer different amounts in the long term.

3. My point was not that doctors don't enjoy what they do. It's that a vast amount of them, when asked if they would do medical *training* again (usually takes until you're 30ish), they said no. You miss out on your 20s entirely. The job itself is fine for most.

And finally, your last point: if you want a degree, you'll put in the effort for it. You seem to be off with your example, as one leads to the other. I'm not disagreeing that people have long term goals, but then people put off the short term goals leading to the long term. If you *want* a degree, you'll study to get it. It's how the world works. My issue comes in when people do it for all the wrong reasons (eg. parental pressure).",1fkqsb
,"1. Just because they don't fix the problem doesn't mean it doesn't matter to them or that they wouldn't prefer to be thinner, or that they're too dumb to know what's good for them. It just means they don't have the will power/discipline or use comfort eating as a crutch to deal with emotions and problems which are only worsened by obesity. 

You could compare it to someone who takes hard drugs. Sure they CHOSE to do it. Sure they KNOW it's bad for them but they do it anyway because they become reliant on a momentary high. This of course creates more problems for which drugs are escape, increasing dependency.

2. I didn't say *all* families. Not all families care if you do drugs or drop out of school or go to jail either, but ones that care about you do. If you start suffering from health problems (diabetes, strokes, arthritis, hypertension) you can't argue that isn't going to affect the people around you.

I live in the uk, Obesity is a huge strain on the NHS. It costs the US billions, not many can pay the huge health costs associated with their weight.  

3. I don't know about that specific example. Are you saying given the choice to re-do life they would not have become doctors? For some maybe that's true although but I find it hard to believe the majority feel that way. Although of course many people regret their career choices and the years wasted on them, it doesn't mean you should never work for anything because you might regret it later.

If you aren't against long-term goals I'm not sure what we're arguing about. I'm simply saying that sometimes you have to sacrifice pleasure in the short term for overall happiness.

Easy_Break,"I was going to say the dumb home improvement project that failed last weekend but I have a better answer: getting involved with furries.          

I did this in the early 90s, I was really into things likey looney tunes, tiny toons, disney afternoon, that kind of thing. So it seemed like a completely logical place to go. The porn and other bullshit was there but not to the degree it became later. And the whole costumes and wanting to be animals was there but absolutely not prominent. I remember being online and 90% of the time it was conversations about cartoons and drawing, etc. Lots of people asking or selling commissions and all that stuff. So wow, absolutely made perfect sense as a cartoonist interested in classic funny animals.          

Little did I know it would turn into a hot mess. The red flags were there but I was a dumb college kid and I had no idea how the world worked, and this was the first time I heard about any kind of fandom. I didn't know that fandoms were a thing that existed. I was a kid and there was no internet just before I found furry.         

So my intention was to get into comics or cartoons or animation or something along those lines. Furry was a huge, gigantic dead end and I wasted years looking through it to find answers or leads. Eventually realized getting involved meant your reputation was down the drain, kinda like how porn stars can't ever get real acting work even if that's what their goal was. All I wanted to do was make comics but I was a sexual deviant by association.

IMadeAnAccountAgain,"It’s definitely weed. 

South Park put it best when they said weed makes you comfortable with being bored. I spent so much time and so many entire days off stoned out of my fucking gourd watching Netflix or just wandering around the city alone. In the beginning it was fine, because I wasn’t shirking any legitimate responsibilities and I was enjoying myself. I’m a big believer that time enjoyed is never time wasted if it’s truly free time. But there was a solid two years where I wasn’t enjoying that life but I was still living it. 

“What did you do over the weekend?”

 “Smoked weed and, uh... wandered around, and saw a movie” 

“how was the movie?” 

“I don’t know, I don’t remember it.”

Fuck that. I could have gotten in shape, learned a new hobby or gone back to school. Nope. 

I’m such a better version of myself clean. ",b0k35w

Zack1018,"Video games. 

I’m gonna copy-paste a kinda long reply I wrote about it the other day: 

> Quitting ""basement gaming"" as a hobby was huge for me.

> I limited my gaming to Pokemon Go (outdoors, encourages exercise and socializing) and local multiplayer (mostly Super Smash Bros) and used my free time to read, learn a new language with Duolingo, and picked up running becuase I was bored and wanted to stay fit.

> Now, almost 5 years later, I am fluent in that 2nd language I started learning with Duolingo, graduated university with honors, took a job in my dream country doing engineering work that i find satisfying and interesting, and I am chasing those last few minutes to a Boston qualifying marathon time (sub 3 hours). When I first moved abroad I met friends playing Pokemon Go and the reading that I did out of boredom at university ended up having a huge impact on my attitude towards life and helped me move past the guilt and shame I felt for my lack of faith in my parents' religion.

> At 20 I couln't have dreamed of how crazy and exciting my life would look now at 23 - and it was all because of productive little things I did when I was bored at university and had nothing better to do. I don't know what my life would look like if I was still playing Battlefield 20 hours a week, but I personally believe it would not  have turned out nearly as well.

> My attitude on gaming/netflix binging/media consumption is this: Time spent bored is time when I really think and evolve and change myself for the better - if I fill all that bored time with familiar video games/shows/memes because they are comforting then I don't progress and I don't have a drive to experience anything new.",b0k35w

TheRealCharlieMunger," 

* Worrying? Part of worrying is trying to figure out “What’s the worst that could happen if…” and developing a contingency plan for mitigating the worst. If the worst never occurs, then yes, you’ve worried for nothing – but if the worst DOES occur, you’ve already planned to deal with it.
* Regretting the Past? Who was it that said ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it""? It’s ok to look back and have regrets, as long as you learn from the mistakes (yours and the mistakes of others) – that’s not a waste of time!
* Watching TV? That’s crazy! I have learned SO much I would never have been exposed to without TV. I’ve seen places and animals, I’ve been exposed to alternative viewpoints, I’ve gained historical and practical knowledge that in another (log cabin) age – I never could have! I would actually have had to travel to all those places and personally have all those conversations and experiences in order to know the things I know now. And while it would be great to travel the world (and space) and DO all that, it’s not practical or economically feasible for me to do that. I *could* have gotten (and do get) much of that information from books, but I find TV to be a valuable source. Even the times I watch for the entertainment value, I find the opportunity to relax my mind and give over to the escapism is NOT a waste of time!
* The Internet? For the learning value mentioned above under TV, the internet is NOT a waste of time. Not to mention the crowdsourcing opportunities which have been proven to empower innovation and creativity and problem-solving! Through the internet, we are SO much smarter than our log-cabin dwelling ancestors because we can have international conversations about any topic any time of the day or night. We are smarter (or maybe I mean more well-informed?) *because* we are communicating internationally in a way never before possible. I don’t think that’s a waste of time! Even Facebook (Mafia Wars notwithstanding, of COURSE that’s a huge waste of time) provides us easy and timely access to friends and family from around the world – it’s an inexpensive way to stay engaged and connected in a forum that provides context in a way that phone conversations or brief visits do not. Also, for those with many “friends” (I was a gamer and have about 3000 “friends” but I only ACTUALLY KNOW about 1/3 of them) – the rest I became “friends” with for the purposes of strengthening my games – but I DID become friends with some of those people and their random thoughts and posts have led to interesting and engaging conversations, not unlike here on Quora!
* Getting Angry? Sometimes that CAN be a waste of time (especially if you can’t change the circumstances that led to your anger) – but people getting ANGRY has led to revolution and change – the settling and founding of America is one example.",b0k35w

I need to add the 10 years I spent dating someone who was never going to be quite ready to make a commitment. Not only did he waste my time, but he eventually altered my whole lifestyle by subtlety poopooing my ideas of things to do for his, all the time. It was so subtle the way he did it, that I barely noticed how much I had changed for him, but him not at all for me. I finally came to my senses and dumped him, but now I have to figure out how to get myself back. WTH was I before him? BTW, he was the one who got me hooked on World of Warcraft. Dick.

BryceWithAWhy,"A high school assembly about drunk driving. Waste of time because everyone knew that the participants were getting a four-day weekend out of it.

One Thursday during my senior year, the powers-that-be had a whole day devoted to the subject of drunk driving. Some students would walk around dressed as zombies and wouldn't be allowed to speak to anyone, supposedly representing people who'd died in drunk driving accidents. And every so often the front office would play some kind of noise over the intercom, to represent the frequency of drunk driving deaths or something.

Then a little bit after noon, the student body was called to a road outside the school, where they'd set up a mock accident scene with two smashed cars and a bunch of students sitting around pretending to be injured. They had the police, the fire department, and a helicopter ambulance there and everything. The re-enactment lasted two hours.

And those students were gone from school the rest of the day because they were ""dead"" or ""in the hospital"" or whatever. IIRC they had an overnight retreat as well, and they weren't present for the following day's classes.

In fact, the next day was a Friday, and the admins had a HUGE assembly in the theater, where the student participants boo-hooed about how ""moved"" they were by the whole experience.

The whole thing was a waste of time, because:

* The timing was blatantly obvious. Prom was like three or four weeks away.
* We knew the students involved weren't dead. There was no permanence to any of this, so their crying about it came off as overly melodramatic.
* We knew the students involved were getting a free four-day weekend AND a bunch of brownie points at the same time. (Gotta begrudgingly admire that scam.)
* We knew that people were going to see through the act, or forget the intended lesson, and drink after prom anyway.
* A girl in our class, who was on the dance squad and pretty well-known, lost her life to drunk driving earlier in the year. So it's not like we hadn't already learned the lesson in some way.

I ended up writing an editorial about it for the school paper, and to this day, I wish they would've done something more meaningful and honest than what was basically a passion play.",b0k35w

It ain't even fun.

I had missed so many games in that year because I felt like I was wasting my $15/month subscription if I played something else. I know some people form friendships in MMOs but I while I was in an active guild I never had a regular group I played with. In the end the only positive to come from it was the fact that I learned that I really don't like MMORPGs. And to make it even worse my account was compromised and even though I've tried working with Blizzard more than once to clear that up I was unable to retrieve my account so now there's absolutely no reason to ever go back.

glassboob,"TL;DR: Waited 15 hours in line just to get a signature on a medical form to be able to enroll.

When I was back in college, certain students had to get a medical certificate from our school’s health services before we got to enroll. The place was notorious for its poor services, specifically the waiting times.

My dad & I arrived at the school’s health service at 4:30 in the morning thinking we would be the first ones in line, but there were already a lot of people. Almost all the seats in the waiting room were occupied.

The doctor lady that was needed to sign our medical forms came in at 12 noon. So of course the parents&students were pissed the hell off. To top it off, some kid who arrived late cut the line because they knew the doctor.

It was our turn. The doctor lady finally signed our forms, got our certificate, took no longer than 5 minutes. We left the health service area at 7PM. We waited 15 HOURS for a 5 MINUTE meeting. Needless to say, me, my dad, & every other parent/student there were pissed as HELL.

What’s worse is the ones that came later than us (those that arrived maybe around 6am) didn’t even get to have their forms signed, & had to come back the next day, again. A lot of them (including us) were just “returnees” (for lack of a better term) because they didn’t make it on the previous days. These parents had to go on leave for their child, to waste a day waiting for nothing.

For a almost two years I was not doing shit for myself and unconsiencely expecting everything to be taken care of.

Loves_me_tacos125,"I went to one of those “go to school for only 8 months and you’ll definitely get a job in this field, we’ll even help you!!” Type of colleges, I think it’s called a ‘trade school’. Anyways, went right after high school and totally regret it. I paid out of pocket, still am, because I had (still do) a job but was below minimum wage and was (still am) living with my parents at the time. I learned a lot, which was nice and a bit useful but the employees there were useless and didn’t care at all if you got a job or not and didn’t care about your education whatsoever. Before graduating, the staff sent us off to our externships where we’d ‘most likely get hired’. Not to anyone’s real surprise but NONE of us got hired at the places we were sent to even tho we were ‘promised’. All my classmates and I started applying places online and when we got interviews we were told to bring in our diplomas, we weren’t given our actual diplomas until our whole schooling was paid off ($20,000). For the people who got financial aid, and given the diplomas, and gave the diploma to the future employer were told by the employer that the diploma was ‘not eligible’ because apparently the school we were all going to “wasn’t legal anymore” or something like that (from what a few classmates told me). So now, our diploma/degree for medical assistant is useless. Hated that school, hated the staff, was a total waste of time and money that I STILL have to pay. ",b0k35w

eddyathome,"Filing for unemployment claims when nothing was computerized back in 1995 or so in PA.

You had to go in person once every two weeks with your claim forms filled out, but they had way too few workers.  I learned to get there no later than 7:00 am (they opened at 8:00) or you wouldn't get seen before noon.  If you showed up after 10:00, you might be seen by closing time.  If you showed up after lunch, they'd tell you to just go home and try the next day.

The form was basically list at least two jobs you applied for, a contact phone number, a contact name, an address, and the job title.  If you didn't have any of that information the job application attempt didn't count which sucked because if you didn't have at least two, you didn't get benefits that week.  Even if you did have all the information they'd grill you for fifteen minutes about why you weren't applying for more jobs or going to school which explains the  wait times.

They also treated you like dirt and that you were stealing money right out of their wallet.  It sucked.

,"This is really insane: but here goes. A guy, a ""friend"", a future ex who I thought I was in love with in high school (a COMPLETE waste of time himself, but that's another story) had some serious psychological/emotional issues and was constantly cutting himself. One day he just announces to our friends and I that he's planning to kill himself in X number of months. I took him aside and spent a couple hours before class trying to convince him not to and begging him to reconsider. I opened up and so did he and we shared our stories. By the end of it we'd become even closer and he promised me he wouldn't do anything stupid. He went home, and wasn't in school for several weeks. I went to EVERYONE trying to find him. I went everywhere. I tried to remember where his house was and knocked on a lot of doors to see if he was okay. I did SO much research. A month or so goes by and he finally turns up, all smiles. Turned out the stupid SOB immediately went home, slit his wrists, and was hospitalized. He never knew, and I never said a word about it to him. 

Second example: I was about to graduate. He wasn't. I was determined to ""save"" him. (HUGE mistake.) I CRASHED my grades... well, I tried...so that I wouldn't graduate, and so I could convince my counselor to let me stay an extra half semester to ""fix"" them. They were still pretty good grades, so I had to beg her to let me stay to ""fix"" my math grade.. The MINUTE I graduated, he disappeared. I was so worried about him because his home life was shit and I needed to know if the guy I loved was dead. Spent over $100 trying to find my friend. He had tried to kill himself again and was also in jail, apparently...and though he denies being in New York, and doesn't know I know it, I saw him in the audience with a group of local girls once on TRL. He even came back a YEAR later with an official MTV hat from the pilot episode of a show they premiered. But he's never been to New York. 

What a total waste of time. What an asshole.

So, I didn't get to develop hobbies with friends and expand relationships. 

I still read, and read stuff that was challenging but ultimately couldn't really ""do"" anything with the knowledge. 

I wish I had tried to develop some hobbies more and found more ways to get involved with the community or something but yeah. Drinking, wandering around, socializing and daily life maintenance chewed up a lot of my downtime.

DudeCome0n,"I played a shit ton of computer games when I was younger.  You know the usually WoW/RuneScape addict.

Got terrible grades, caused myself a ton of grief because I procrastinate and neglect school.  Teachers/Parents/Adults always told me the video games did nothing for you and were just a waste of time.  Luckily I am intelligent enough to put in minimal effort to get through school.   

Well.   I am an adult professional in my 20s, who needs to use a computer to do stuff.   Guess who's much better at using a computer than 99% of their co-workers.  

I can confidently say now that my years of clicking around in computer games, quickly hitting buttons, and just absorbing information kind of paid off.

Things I take for granted like being able to quickly click through folders, or switch back and forth between multiple tabs  - I watch other people and see they are about 10 times slower than me.  Like wtf go faster.   It took me a while to realize that my years of gaming probably helped whatever fine motor skills deal with clicking stuff.

Even the people my age who grew up with computers and stuff aren't usually faster than me because they were to busy doing English homework, instead of grinding out that full set of Rune Armor.

I'm not saying video games are better than school work and just being responsible.  But I do think they gave me some skills that I use in the real world. ",b0k35w
,"That’s not really a waste of time to be honest. It’s still productive and in my opinion it’s still a skill.

If someone has an attitude of 'If this isn't forever it's a waste' then it would be a terrifying prospect to begin a new relationship ever.  
I get that if you are together for a long time, eventually it evolves in your head of spending the rest of your lives together - But if that doesn't happen - Ok, It might hurt. But it would hurt more to be spending that time with someone who's not as into it than you.

The things you achieved personally are still there. Perhaps you learned patience or something else meta, maybe a skill or even worked out what you wanna be when you are grown-up.

You've learned the type of person you are, the type of person you need, and, although delivered rather harshly perhaps, the signs to know the difference.   


Relationships aside, think of all the things you've done in those 8 years. Maybe it's career advancement, or mastering a hobby, or the different types of beer you drank, or those photos of sunsets, or your league of legends rank (Bronze 2 here RIP me). The books you've read, the movies you've watched, the quotes that made you tear up, the news that made you more worldly, a pet that held your heart, the person you helped on the street.

&#x200B;

All of these types of things mean you're developing as a soul in this world, and whether these specific ones apply to you or not, you know there are things that make up your identity. I'm sorry this happened, but I've been there too, and I can promise that you didn't waste your time; you grew, and that's what really matters. No matter how abrupt, hurtful, or crushing this breakup was, and I'm sure that it was, your spirit only dies if you let it. Get back out into the world and experience all it has to offer. Take it slow, but you can do it.

xandermander24,"Different cultures have different ideas about time (chronemics), meaning that some cultures are highly punctual (monochronic) while others are not as strict about it (polychronic).

My dad is polychronic, and even though I grew up in the U.S., I still express a lot of cultural habits of my family.

So, unless I make it a huge deal and remind myself multiple times, I am often ""late"" because I am just not worried about it. (To clarify, I do not mean that I don't care about time at all, it's more like I plan to meet *around* 4:30, rather than *at* 4:30, and I don't stress about 4:45 or so.)

I structure my schedule like ""after I get off, I have a doctor's appt. and after that I need to go shopping for groceries"" rather than ""I get off work at 4, go to the dr. at 4:30, go grocery shopping at 6.""

This approach works well with my family. We often will make plans to be at someone's house (in the family) and even if we say ""about 4:30"" you can almost always expect closer to 5:00.

Of course, I still am not broken of this, and people here are much stricter about time.

I love games and the stories that they can tell, but they are absolutely vampires of productivity and education.

Video games in and of themselves are not a problem, but addiction is and video games can be addictive. 

I agree entirely about media consumption. I grew up when ""media consumption"" was watching scheduled TV, occasionally watching a VHS, listening to a radio in the car, and reading newspapers/books/magazines. Media consumption was a *much* smaller part of our lives 25 years ago than it is today.

I think it is also telling that I never thought/heard of a term like ""media consumption"" until very recent modern times. It seems as if the entire point of media in 2019 is for people to consume as much as possible and produce little/nothing.  *shrugs* Maybe that's why sequels/reboots are way more common in 2019 than in 1994.

CumboxMold,"I'm 31 and have been single for almost 6 years. I don't want kids and never have.

A huge reason why I don't want kids, and to a certain extent getting married, is because of this mentality. I don't want any man I'm with to accuse me of tying him down and ruining his life. I'm not generalizing but I don't think men are biologically suited for that lifestyle anyway (maybe even most women as well, they just do a better job of handling it) and that's why they leave women behind after they got them pregnant. Or they cheat after they get married.

There's no law/mandate/social rule that says you MUST be married and have kids. I wish more people understood this. More people would be happier. If it pisses off your family, oh well, they're not the ones who will have to deal with the fallout. YOU are. They may not even be there to help. If you want a life of being single and doing whatever you want, or being partnered up with no kids, or married with no kids, or whatever else you want, that's completely up to you and very possible. Even people who are from very conservative cultures and don't want to go the traditional route have managed to escape. 

You don't know what to do? Talk to her about it. Maybe she feels the same way. Please be honest. You're 32 and you're not too old. Don't ruin her life and yours. Better to break up now than after this summer when you're legally tied to each other; it's free right now, after that it will cost a lot.",b0k35w
throwaway_workin,"PLEASE don't have children if you aren't 100% sure it's what you want. Look up sunk-cost fallacy. You are not doing anyone a favor. If it turns out this isn't what you want, you've taken precious time away from your gf to find someone who actually wants the same things as she does and you've brought innocent children into your potentially shitty marriage. Being with a partner who is unhappy is an even bigger waste of time than being single after a 7-year relationship.",b0k35w
Nafemp,"Don't.

That's a rat trap you don't want to go down and it's also sunken cost fallacy.

If you're unhappy now you're going to be unhappy later and while it seems like you might be able to 'tough it out' today there's no telling how the stress of being unhappy is going to weigh on you in 5,10,15 years time and how you'll end up coping with it.

The last thing you want to do is torture your SO with a decades long unhappy marriage that might lead you to screw up your kids as well. That's far worse than a measly 7 years especially if you both are still in your 20's in which case she has plenty of time to find someone else.

I'd recommend getting therapy and processing these emotions first with a therapist before making any hasty decisions but don't just do it for her as it'll end up hurting her and you in the long run.",b0k35w

Of course I'm a completely different person so my personal experience might just simply be different but I feel the GE courses were hit and miss for me and were completely dependent on the professor and what they had to offer the class. I can definitely say I feel more well rounded and educated than I was 4 years ago and I can attribute that to a fair few of my GE courses.

,"As someone who is currently in university. I agree with this totally. I'm doing an advertising degree which I thought would be a good mix of creative and business.

I'm only doing this to get a degree just to get a job. This may seem extreme but sometimes I feel like i'm in a dictatorship that's ran by pieces of paper. People think it's ok because they get to choose what degree they want to be ruled over by but it's not.

Where I'm from it can take almost one whole day. There are traditions in groom's and brides place first (blessings, some games), so closest family and their parties get together as early as 11 am. Ceremony is usually late afternoon 5pm or so  and takes about an hour - to two hours tops. But with photoshoot it can take a while.  Usually ceremony is in a different venue than reception so it takes some commuting (accompanied with loud music, singing and honking). By the time the reception starts officially it can be as late as 8pm. It has it's program too, but rarely anyone leaves before midnight (cutting cake time). Guests can stay as late as 5am. 

I've been to few weddings when I got home 11am the next day.

IMadeAnAccountAgain,"I smoked near-daily for about three years and I quit in July of last year. I quit by simply deciding I was done and getting rid of everything - I flushed what little I had left and threw out my bowls, grinder, etc. I didn't give myself ""one last big hurrah"" or anything like that because I figured that would only make it harder, and I wasn't in the mood for it anyway. I was honestly sick of the stuff and sick of being high, sick of never getting a decent night's sleep and sick of feeling drawn out when I was sober.

I don't live in a legal state. Weed isn't at all hard to come by here, but it does require a little foresight and planning and contacting the right people. Deliberately getting rid of everything really made it easier, because even though I knew I could get it within an hour at any time of the day, that was a long enough waiting period to give me time to steel my resolve. 

Temptation was not really a problem for me, because I was mentally sick of it but also because I started feeling better from day two and I held on to that feeling. The dreams were pretty bad for a while, and to be honest I still haven't fully gotten used to dreaming again. 

I have smoked since July, though very very rarely and only in social situations. I find that if I use it as a special occasion, party sort of thing, it's still fun and it doesn't dominate my life and I don't really feel any of the downsides. But we're talking a total of four times since July. Always with friends who are also stoned, always with a group activity happening, never ever alone. In truth, allowing myself the freedom to smoke in appropriate situations has made it easier, because it's less of a forbidden fruit. I didn't 'quit', really, it's just 'not something I do anymore'. Having a more casual mindset about it helps me not to consider it as a stressful thing. This obviously wouldn't work if it was a more physically addictive drug like coke. 

Are you considering quitting? I'd be happy to offer any more detailed advice if you have questions or just want to talk. Feel free to pm me.",b0k35w

Have you ever seen the movie Under the Tuscan Sun? There's a part in there where the main character says something to the effect of ""it should actually kill you.

You are going to hurt for many months, maybe even years. But each day gets a little tiny bit better. I'm sure he cares about you, and he seems cold because all you want is for him to you want you. But he has to be that way to end things. And if you love him as much as you say you do, you would want him to be happy, even if it wasn't with you. Otherwise you don't really love him, you just love the feeling of being in love with him. You will find happiness again. I've been through many heartbreaks, and each one felt like I would never find someone as good as they were. But you will be surprised when you find that again. Keep your head up, accept the pain, push yourself to pursue things that bring you joy. Find something positive in each day.

This is why I'm planning on going through with it. I do work hard - I own a business, work full time as an engineer, and I own my house and also a rental property, both of which were foreclosures I completely remodeled myself.

She's a hard worker too, a private school teacher who is great with kids. I'm at the point where I know people with 10 year old kids and I covet their ability to have an empty nest by age 45, something that won't happen to me until I'm almost 60. Seeing my parents at 60 is harrowing... ageing doesn't do good things to people and now that my parents are close to retirement, they're doing all sorts of awesome things but can't do a lot of stuff they wanted to do when they were younger.

You're completely right. I'm really just contemplating whether I want to devote the next 20 years to kids, or whether I want to continue living with all kinds of disposable income and time to spend it on. I'm now realizing that I need to focus on creating a family, a legacy, and not shy away from shit because ""it's hard.""

Life is all about hard, but I'm the poster child for ""getting out of it what you put into it"" and I'm prepared to accept that challenge. It's just going to be hard to get used to after spending the last 10ish years as a bachelor and ""cool uncle.""",b0k35w

For me, it was music. I had been in band throughout high school, dropped it during college.


After a very long and arduous break-up, I fell head first into music production and DJing.


I'm headlining at a club for the very first time soon, and the feeling of what I have accomplished not only brings me joy, but it has also inspired a lot of my friends in doing so, which I now also take immense pleasure in helping them through their paths.

The second thing: Help someone.

I live in the southern US. I'm not from a ""western"" culture either (Mexican) and they are the very first ones that exposed me to the idea that men resent their wives/families.

In the southern US, as you may know, people can be very religious but also extremely hypocritical. They were the second ones that exposed me to the idea. My area is full of single mothers and deadbeat baby daddies. American men in general resent the child support system yet don't do anything to prevent making babies they didn't mean to make. They hate the idea of paying for anything, yet either get insulted when women make their own money or want to live off of a woman while they play video games/watch porn all day at home. Then when the woman tells him to pull his own weight, he insults her and claims some crap about ""muh feminism"".

I exclusively date non-American and non-Mexican men. I've never been with a guy who was from a western culture yet not American, so I can't speak for them. The American men will give you lip service about how they want to get married and have your babies... then when the time comes they hate it and try to break off, either literally or by staying in a marriage/relationship they no longer want and growing more resentful by the day. The other men will claim it's wrong to leave women/babies in their culture, yet from what I've seen it's OK to cheat and even have other families, as long as you support them all and your primary wife it's OK.

theonlydidymus,"YouTube.

Until very recently I was very invested in a handful of channels that I *really* liked. These channels updated daily and had some pretty good content. I was sure to prioritize my time each day to be able to get some of my favorite videos in, and I even got YouTube Red because I like to watch on mobile and can't get rid of ads with adblock on all platforms.

Skipping boring details, I got YouTube Red, then I cancelled the subscription. I liked it, just didn't want to spend money.

So here I am now, still *thinking* I like these channels, but the truth is that a lot of content on YouTube these days is just trying to beat the system to advertise better. Even the people who claim they do things for their viewers *aren't*. 

The best example I can give you is the CaptainSparklez/Ssundee/Crainer series Trollcraft. Sparklez knows his audience, tries to make decent content, and ultimately does some decent stuff, but you can tell some of his choices are strategised for his income. Ssundee ***knows*** that his audience is *very* young and makes his videos for kids. If you watch some of his meta/vlog stuff you know that all the *stupid crap* he does is because of the kids that watch his channel. Then there's Crainer. Crainer gears his videos toward the YouTube algorithm. He does a daily upload of over 10 minutes, his thumbnails are all clickbait, and he never numbers or titles his videos in a way that you can easily sort through them. Everything Crainer does is for subs and views. He even started trying to take things in a ""creative direction"" completely disregarding the feedback he was getting from his audience. He doesn't care about his individual subscribers, he just cares that the number goes up.

As time has gone on and as YouTube has evolved, this has become more and more apparent in more than just gaming channels. The motivation these days *isn't* to do what you love, no matter how many youtubers will tell you that. It's their job, and they have to do what they have to do to make money or they'll have to stop making videos.

TL:DR - YouTube.",5zxuq0

They are also different from movies or TV series. I watch a movie, I waste two hours. I watch some TV series, I waste 3-4 hours tops.

I feel like no one gives a shit if you have an unironed shirt, everyone just pretends they give a shit. If I see someone with an unironed shirt I think ""Good for them, they obviously had something more worthwhile to do."" because every time I have to iron anything I have about ten things in the back of my head that would be a better use of my time.

Even in every day life, you can get away with not ironing a shirt if you have it on under a suit jacket. But honestly I used to work with people who didn't iron their shirts and I don't think anyone cared unless they wanted a reason to berate someone or something to make small talk about.

Exceptions exist if you're at a wedding or funeral, or a job interview but I've seen people turn up to all three of those with perfectly ironed shirts and terrible haircuts but no one cares about the haircut. Similarly, people dress in a suit and tie for these things because that's supposed to be smart but the general public doesn't care if the suit doesn't fit properly, which looks way worse than an unironed shirt that fits.

I actually like nice clothes that fit properly, but ironing is bullshit and no one is convincing me when I watch shows set in the 19th or early 20th century that all those gangsters or lords or whoever were wearing perfectly tailored and pressed clothes all the fucking time.

beermejesus,"At 28' he realized the secret to all life.  The secret that had been avoiding him, almost humorously, thus far.  That all time was fixed, that we are cars on a track, that the 4th dimension was just that, a dimension, as finite and resolute as the previous three.

Everything he had ever done or would do, had been done 1 million times over and would be done again to the same degree.  

God spoke to him.  Well, to the right hemisphere of his brain anyway.  It tingled and spoke, full of retort and spunk, it taunted him in moments of uncertainty, was present in moments of regret.  

What good was this god?  It was there, that was for certain.  But how?  And why?  Was it spritely and just, as Puck, or nefarious and ill conceived, as he would want to believe, in order to reassure his own impure motives.  The only recourse that he had remaining was to document the impressions and influence of this force, this supernatural tenant superimposing its will upon every moment that he laid awake.  

Every moment of doubt, recrimination, guilt, triumph, elation, self loathing, all returned to him in due time, and equaled a zero sum gain.  It canceled itself out, in the long run.  

That was the essential lie of time, he decided.

That it makes fools of us all.  We waver, up and down, like a wave beset.  Ultimately finding that our frequency has only one logical endpoint, one destination; a straight line.  Redundancy, a proof, the canceling of all things until only the singularity emerges.  As stark and naked as it is beautiful.  

What else could be said other than that this life is a simulation?  A tree falls in the forest, if no one is around, does it produce a noise?  A wave is a wave until is is observed and then it is a particle?  Schroedingers muse.  It all points to the same thing.  That only the observer dictates what is, that this universe was constructed for appreciation and observation, not inert materialism.

There is a creator, and it is righteous.  Maybe not just for us.

SapphireEcho,"Stories with sad endings.

Anime, video games, books, whatever-- I come here to escape. To dream, if only for a short time, of a world where miracles happen and happily ever after exists. I don't give one flying, flaming, million dollar FUCK about whether or not it's realistic enough. I don't care very much for excuses about it, either. And I realize that to some degree, there are times where a tragedy makes literary sense for character growth or some other plot point. But most of it I just can't really abide, even if I know it's childish, simply because I want a story where everyone is happy in the end. Personally, I don't see why wanting that is looked down upon these days. I refuse to accept that a story has to have a bittersweet ending in order for it to be good.

For instance: as a twin, I will never be okay with Fred's death in Harry Potter. I don't care that in real life, not everyone makes it out of war. I don't care! For God's sake, let us have some fucking happiness at the end of a story without having to tarnish the whole thing with ""realistic"" bullshit. You're gonna tell me Snape, potions master who regularly hung out around a giant poisonous snake, had no trick up his sleeve for that one? Or did he just have to die because the author didn't know how else to wrap up his story?

It's a book that takes place in a world with magic! Everyone is LITERALLY a fucking wizard! Jesus, woman, pull off a miracle or two!

Creativity can't exist without states of contemplation and relative inactivity (at least mentally). There is a reason people who write do a lot of their best thinking in the shower. It's one of the few times that they allow themselves to be mentally inactive and zone out.

Also, muscles can't be built without periods of rest between periods of activity. Time should be seen as something we spend in a balanced fashion. Nothing is a ""waste of time"", though some time is spent in an imbalanced fashion which minimizes potential. ",5zxuq0

,"I played many and I half agree. Think for myself included, most of the allure about MMO anything is community based. The other half is getting gear to PvP/sPvP. If those two things really don't interest you then the PvE alone isn't gonna cut it. 


A few games/MMO that I felt was a waste of time anything that has a shop for gear/currency and not purely cosmetic.


Currently got into PoE and while it's an ARPG it still sort of counts. The lack of currency and cashing items makes it much better and the trade system is great. I played Diablo 2 (+LoD) like a crack addict as a child and PoE really covered that genre very well. Diablo 3 not so much. But whatever I'm rambling.

I invested a lot of time in GW/GW2 and looking back, GW2 became a cash grab but there's nothing that can compare to the overall content of that game. I still find GW to be better, but whatever.

Also played PWI (lol kill me), BnS, Revelations Online and so many others. Those games alone almost killed my desire to touch another MMO. Cash grab and currency really ruins a game. Especially when it's so easy to bot them, there's just too much grind and the communities really were just shit.

It took me 6 years to evolve from the guy that quietly drink in a table to the guy that just dances all night long.

silversatire,"You're right if you're talking about the majority of cover letters that are personalized by just swapping out the company name. Snooze, look at the next one, repeat. But that's because most people don't seem to know how to write a good cover letter and make it mean something to the person reading it.

Cover letters should be an introduction to you and your resume and speak very, very specifically about why you are a good match. E.g. ""as you can see by my experience at XYZ company I raised widget production by 10% over 2 years - and as your company is expanding in the widget space, I believe my experience in maximizing efficiency here would be a benefit.""

Yes, I'll see on your resume that you did that without needing a cover letter. But if you take the time to translate that on your cover letter, I know A) you did your research about my company, not just yourself and B) you know what you are talking about. That at least gets you a second look. Bonus points if you seem to really care about the widgets.

It even tells you to just come in and have a chat with the boss, and let the boss decide if you're good enough to be hired.

Went to a burger store, employees wore casual clothes and smoked cigarettes. Nobody cares or complains. Went to a computer store, and the boss wears a pyjama while helping customers. Nobody cares or complains either. They were all nice people, and were shocked when I told them about the difficulties in even getting a minimum wage job in Canada.

,"The sad thing too, is that grammar can be made fun. No kid (or adult even) wants to sit in a class picking apart sentences to label clauses, phrases, and the parts of speech. When you start teaching grammar in a rhetorical way, it's so much better. You get to see why the language is used the way it is and how different styles of grammar influence your message.

Plus teaching it this way doesn't give the inherent message of ""if you speak a dialect, you're uneducated."" Proper grammar is important, but it's also imperative to teach students WHY it's important.

kittyface93,"I agree with this mostly. I think I get what you're saying--not that we shouldn't teach kids how to speak in an academic setting, but that focusing on grammatical terminology is virtually useless. It would probably be a lot more effective to teach them how to communicate in certain contexts and how their words may be interpreted differently in different settings, rather than forcing them to memorize what a subordinate clause or whatever is. I personally remember none of that from grade school because it's not at all helpful in my daily life, and I'm currently getting my PhD. It's all a bunch of arbitrary jargon made up by grammaticians, and not at all reflective of how people speak and think about language in practice. 

But also, I personally see the idea of there being a ""proper"" way to speak extremely problematic for certain populations. This idea systematically benefits some while disadvantaging all others quite arbitrarily. There's no ""naturally"" better way to speak than any other--all that depends on who is in power and gets to define what ""good language"" is. But then again, you have to speak in the socially understood mainstream ""proper"" fashion in order to succeed. That's just the way it is, so we can't not teach this language to kids in schools.

The Tories don't understand that a lot of kids from poor areas can barely get through basic English, let alone complex grammar. That sort of thing should be left to secondary school age, where the classes are separated by ability, those at the bottom can continue building on the basics and the more able children can learn grammar.

Gamer husband here. I hate when guys behave like yours. 
It makes the rest of us look bad! 
 
Video games are my main form of entertainment. After we got married my wife admitted that she was worried about even dating me, nevermind marrage. 
 
But every day i make the bed and do dishes. In general i vacuum, take out the garbage and cleaning the bathroom WAY more than she does. Plus I get my own weight lifting exercises and cardo done. I spend time taking her on dates. I hang out with friends and family, too. 
  
So when I wanna load up a game she is totally cool with it. I'm currently playing Shadow Of Mordor, but some days we sometimes play video games together. 
 
Maybe you two can gently work out a compromise... 
You learn to play video games with him (the Lego are beginner family friendly) and he learn to carry his weight around the chores. But he really should put his wife and kids above entertainment software.

Having a practical baseline makes putting names and formal rules to parts of speech much easier.

This is the route I took. I was a voracious reader as a child and teen, but didn't have much formal grammar instruction until later; however, when I entered college I found I had an intuitive grasp of the written word, which I further refined and directed through English and journalism classes.

A bag of 5 sandwich buns costs about $6, lettuce is 2, various other stuff adds up to about 7 more, that totals approximately $15 for 5 sandwiches (or more), whereas subway's cost 9 bucks for only one. Make a casserole, and boom you have enough for 3-4 days of dinner! If you work 10 hours days I can understand it, but to say that you *have* to go out to eat because a greasy takeout is faster than your souffle, well I dunno about that.",5zxuq0
midwintermoons,"I agree. It's actually kind of awesome when you only have one or two people to cook for, because you can get multiple meals out of a standard recipe sized for 4-6 people. Double or triple the recipe and freeze most of it, and you've got a bunch of easy meals. 

Here's a short list of things that always freeze well if anybody needs a place to start:

* Pureed soups and chilis (Ziploc ""medium square"" disposable tupperware containers are perfect for freezing two portions, ""small square"" for one portion)

* Uncooked burger patties (freeze solid on a cookie sheet, then layer between wax paper in freezer bag)

* Uncooked meatballs (freeze solid on a cookie sheet, then transfer to freezer bag)

* All casseroles, unbaked

* Extra buns

* Tomato sauce

So, for example, I'll make a big pot of soup/stew/chili/curry for dinner one night for me and my husband. It's really not much more work to make a double or triple batch since you're doing it anyway. I made eight servings, so we eat some that night and the next night. I freeze the other four servings for later.

We buy two pounds of meat and a pack of eight buns. That night we make eight burger patties, only cook two, put the other two in the fridge for the next night, and freeze the other four. Also freeze the other four buns.

Frozen casseroles go in the fridge the night before you want to cook them, then into the oven before you turn it on (to bring the cold pan up to temp slowly) or on the counter for bit. Meatballs can go straight into the pan from the freezer, no thawing needed.

Obviously you'll still be doing a bit of cooking on the day you want most of these things to round out the meal, but it will be the very easy things like a green salad, rice, or noodles. All the hard work you've done ahead of time.",5zxuq0

We also don't know OP's situation either, so its really all speculation and we're not hearing both sides here. 

To OP: Have you talked to your husband and been forthcoming with your concerns? I have noticed that many people in relationships tend to internalize a lot of their issues, often times for the sake of retaining stability when often times, it just makes the problem worse. I assume you have, but if you haven't I would recommend being completely honest and forthcoming with your concerns and then going from there.

Hitlers_Taint,"One of, if not *the* most commonly used arguments in favour of protecting the environment is the ""think of the children"" argument, or one of its variations. The argument goes: Your actions have consequences that will affect future generations. If those actions have negative consequences (using fossil fuels, destroying beautiful lanscapes) then you've done something bad to future generations. You will almost certainly have heard one of the many variations of this argument, often used in anti-pollution ad campaigns (""What will you leave for your children?"")

For this argument to have any merit at all, it assumes the moral importance of people that don't yet exist (future generations). This argument therefore necessarily ascribes moral value to unborn people, and suggests their life is of as much importance as someone alive now. 

However, if we accept this necessary assumption in the case of this argument, we have to accept it in every case, including, most obviously, the case of abortion: if we say that the life of children not yet born should determine our actions in the case of climate change, then we are logically obligated to rethink our entire outlook on abortion, which would, by this same logic, be considered murder.

It therefore seems that either one must give up the pro-abortion argument (which I refuse to do), or forfeit the ""think of the children"" argument. Now, of course there are more arguments than this in the anti-climate change arsenal, but this one is by far the most commonly used, and the most problematic.",5zxuq0

I mean, they still exist, The Brick is still heavily advertised obviously, but there's no more Twisto's crap and an company name attached to *absolutely everything*. It makes sense though, the budget for the Canadian version is probably a fraction of the American, but it's still annoying I agree.

However, disregard that, BB Canada does some things I hate compared to the American one.

1) Triple evictions. Such an obvious and stupid way to speed up the show. I don't mind a double eviction (though I'd prefer they just do 1), but triple is just absurd. Last season Canada had 2 (maybe even 3) doubles, and 1 triple. 

2) Advantages that are so very clearly targeted towards specific houseguests that are surely getting evicted, but the producers want to stay because drama sells. Biggest (and most infuriating) example was the double veto Britnee and Sarah got in Season 3. Both were on the block. House hated them both. BB sets up a ""Canada Votes"" where they say ""give 2 people have nots and a <secret> advantage"". Advantage ends up being a double fucking veto and since they only had each other, clearly they would use them on each other. The fact that it was a secret advantage lets the producers set it up in such a way that they can cherry pick what they actually get depending on who Canada votes for.

3) Canada has decided that it would be fucking awesome to have a laugh track now. I've noticed it in previous seasons, but it was pretty subtle and only during certain exchanges. However, in Season 5 they ramped it the fuck up, and now you hear the audience laughing CONSTANTLY, and it's no longer subtle. It's literally like a sitcom now.

4) No zingbot. Fucking love zingbot.

I still watch BB Canada, because holy shit I love Big Brother, but they do some really stupid shit.

In an ideal scenario, you're absolutely right. Logically speaking, that's how romantic relationships *should* develop: meet, become friends, become close friends, then date, then love. That only makes sense.

UNFORTUNATELY, that doesn't happen very often. As frustrating as it is, the logical progression of a relationship really doesn't apply to romance. Believe me, I've wound up friend zoned plenty of times and I've done a *ton* of homework on the subject of dating as a result. The bottom line is, with the incredibly rare exception, that formula doesn't work when it comes to mating/dating. Women usually make up their minds about a man pretty fast when it comes to whether he's dateable or not. It's been a while since I've read up on this particular subcategory of relationships so I couldn't give you an exact explanation. Essentially the idea is that you have to make your intentions clear pretty quickly after you first meet a girl and create some sexual tension​.",5zxuq0

**Day 1:** Season chicken and roast with 1-2 potatoes, 1 onion, 2 carrots, saving the peels and trimmings. This usually lasts me 3-4 days. Strip the meat off the carcass and save the bones.

**Day 2:** Place the vegetable trimmings, as well as another onion and carrot or two, plus a few celery stalks and the celery leaf ends, in a large stock pot and bring to a simmer. Roast the chicken bones for 30-45 minutes and add them to the pot. Simmer for several hours till a fairly dark, fragrant stock forms, then let cool, strain and save in the fridge. Should get close to 15 quarts if done right.

**Day 4:** Make a large pot of chicken noodle soup with any leftover chicken, 3-4 quarts of stock, a cup or two of soup noodles, carrot, celery stalk, and half an onion, plus seasonings (e.g. parsley, oregano). This should last 3-5 days.

**Second Week:** Make various rice and rice/lentil pilafs (rice/lentil/cumin is a good mix) with the chicken broth, as well as remaining carrots, onions and celery. 

**Breakfast:** Granola and almond milk (I have a dairy allergy).

For variety, you can make the soup later, between pilafs or whatever. Also, this leaves a huge amount of potatoes, so mashed potatoes or roasted potato wedges can give additional variety.",5zxuq0

Bearded_Wildcard,"How are sports not artistic creations? It's the exact same. They are all entertaining forms of media. 

Watching someone crush a 99mph baseball 450 feet is an art form.

Watching a hockey player snipe a shot into the top shelf past a goalie who takes up 75% of the goal is an art form.

The competitive, and non-scripted aspects of it set it apart from things like theatre, or movies, but at the end of the day it's a performance of sorts.

deelar,"I think people who turn their nose up at sports in favor of a what is traditionally called ""the arts"", are being hilariously ironic in their snobbery.  I.e. Meryl Streep giving a speech, talking about how martial arts aren't art. What an absolute fool.

Professional athletic events are artistic masterpieces. The dedication to continual honing of ones body, movement, and technique for any sport, including competitive martial arts, is perfectly analogous to that required by the prima ballerina. And one doesn't even need to squint that hard to see the same expression of craft by an actor or even a painter, all the same.

Thousands and thousands of hours practicing the perfect execution of ones movement through 3D space, and one's ability to perceive the world and interact with it well in their medium of choice. The difference between a movie and a football game is that a football game is real time with a simplified goal, rather than a non-real time event with a complicated goal for the agents involved.  The level of human ability, dedication, intelligence, and grace required to put on the masterpiece of the World Cup or even of an NFL game is the same as for a Hollywood film or even a musical album, and the end result is of a different category but an identical caliber, so to speak.  Typically amazing feats from fellow humans are easy for the open-mind to find intriguing. 

Even the sub plots that happen in professional athletics are fucking amazing and are quite easily to relate to if you're a person with empathy and you're able to think metaphorically.  Champions taking defeats, and the way they carry themselves afterwards.  Players consciously sacrificing their health and playing even with broken bones in some cases to help their team mates achieve victory. Old players.. like Ross, his last MLB game at 40 years old, playing with the cubs at the World Series. Absolutely blows it in the last game, and gets a pitch to the face, almost losing the lead. 5 minutes later in the game he solidifies his legacy and the cubs lead with a crushing home run.  Seriously just riveting stuff, and the level of humility that man has (and many professional athletes in general) should serve as an example for someone's children the same way as one might expect from our mythical heros from the arts. 

There's virtually no difference, and I truly think people who scoff at sports just can't see reality because they tie so much of their identity in the idea that there is some strict boundary between the various forms of human expression.  You can even personally test this yourself. Take up an athletic endeavor, and also one you consider ""artistic"". You will be blown away at the similarities you find constantly.. also, take a look at portal ido. These people call themselves ""movement"" practitioners, and they blend the traditional boundary between artistic and athletic movements while training world champion mma fighters and NFL players and the like.",5zxuq0

I never said this wasn't the case. I'm not saying to go out and burn forests down or pour oil into the ocean. My only argument is that I have so far not found a moral imperative to protect the environment.

    public void testNothingSample() {
        dummyClass.method();
    }

During the second one they came in and asked if everything was okay because I was still awake.

The sleep study found that for some reason I wasn't getting enough slow wave sleep. But I think that ""some reason"" might have been that the sleep study was in a building immediately adjacent to a major freeway junction and the entire building shook every time a truck went by which was frequently, the bed was uncomfortable, the wires were uncomfortable, and the room wasn't very dark.

- Even the things he DOES do (wash and dry laundry) he doesn't even finish the job and leaves the time-consuming part of folding and putting away to her.

All of these are leeching behaviors. All of these are inconsiderate of *her* time by making her do all the work. So yeah, he's an inconsiderate asshole if he can't scale back his gaming by 1 freaking hour a day to do the goddamn dishes and take out the trash.

I know this because I used to *be* that guy. I used to do the bare minimum to please my live-in gf and spend as much time as possible playing video games. Then I realized she was constantly tired from having to work *and* do all the household maintenance, whereas I was just working and coming home to play games. I realized she didn't have any hobbies because she didn't have time for them with all the shit that I should have been helping her with because I'm a human being living in the same space she was. I realized that because I was being an inconsiderate asshole, I was sapping all of her energy and driving a wedge between us.

Now, I pull my weight. I do dishes, I vacuum, I take out the trash, I do laundry (including folding and putting away) and we have more quality time together. And when I do feel like killing a few hours with video games she's totally fine with it because I don't let it consume my life or drive me to be a leech anymore.

$1.50 lunches in cafe w/ in-house bar/brewery after 4pm, free laundry, gym, 20 days PTO + 7 company holidays + winter break.

Everyone gets a desk and your supervisor is basically the CMMS (IBM Maximo). As long as you get your assigned work order tasks done in a safe and timely manner so that production isn't delayed, you're set. They try to take care of everything in-house so you'll have to take care of everything from air handlers, clean room doors and walls, to product piping and plumbing. If the job is too big they contract out.  Utilities is electrical, steam, and WFI lines. Metrology is physical instrumentation repairs and calibration.

Engineering takes care of big picture stuff and troubleshooting if a fix isn't apparent or product loss may occur. Instrumental Engineering is HMI maintenance and recipe programming.

• Dating, and the small talk/""getting to know you"" conversation-dance we all do. As in, ""I'm gonna tell you just enough interesting things about me, but conveniently leave out the bits that nobody likes so you can discover that later on, when it's too late and you're hopefully in love with me by then."" (re: why ""just be yourself"" is and will always be bullshit).

• Breakfast.

• Dropping a deuce. I don't know how normal people ""efficiently"" pinch loaves--like, I'll hear from others ""Oh I just go in, pop a squat, wipe up then leave; why does it take you so long?"" Oh maybe because my system likes to fake me out. I go in, sit down, go through Round One... then mentally argue with my guts about whether there's a Round Two or whether the pressure from Round One just echoed back to make it *think* there might be a Round Two.

• Waiting for Rick & Morty season 4. Or just generally ""waiting for the next season of great shows that are still running.""",9ll4fn

At 6:30 I shower, at 6:45 I take them both out for a stroll. The schnauzer has to take two dumps or else I’ll clean up a mess later in the day. Most days this morning two-poop walk takes 30 minutes. So one hour in the am just devoted to my dogs eating, medicine, pissing and shitting. A few days a week I’m able to pop in around 11 am to take them out for a 20 minute walk. Schnauzer will most definitely romp another dook.  I’m home by 4 and one or two days a week the schnauzer has pissed on the kitchen floor, because his diabetes makes him thirsty af and he’s blind so he can’t see the peepee pads that the corgi has no problem finding. So I spend 20 minutes cleaning and mopping that. Evening food, pills, and insulin at 5:30. Another walk. And another walk at 9 before I go to bed.

I may have a problem. I may not. I've seen a few doctors and they've all told me that my urinary concerns are rather normal and that there's nothing wrong with me. Anyone else pee like 20 times per day? And wake up three times every night?

It's not that peeing itself is time consuming, but it *is* extremely intrusive. I have to pause what I'm doing and often lose my focus simply because I have to pee. Then it takes time to get back to where I was. It doesn't take that long to get back, but damn is it annoying. That time adds up. 15 seconds 20 times per day over a year...Hold on (you don't have to since you're not reading this in real time).

The single biggest timewaster is clothing. Get him dressed in the morning, then undressed before his nap, then dressed again, then undressed before his bath, then in PJs. 

Dressing a toddler is like a box of chocolates, so to say... Sometimes they cooperate and it takes 2 minutes. Sometimes you have to chase them around the house as they scream and flop down on the floor like a pile of limp noodles because putting socks on is the literal worst thing that can ever happen to them.

 Then I have to help him to the potty 5+ times a day. Sit there as he's chattering away for 10 minutes even though he was done peeing after 30 seconds, but now he refuses to get up (he probably also put up a fight because he didn't want to go, but now he's sitting there, he doesn't want to get back up and go play). Pants off, wiping, pants on. Sometimes he insists on removing all his clothes, not just pull down his pants. More dressing operations for me. And don't even get me started on when he *doesn't* pee/poop on the potty and has an accident. It's all of that, PLUS handwash poopy underwear and (depending on the gravity of the situation) give him a shower too.

My days were usually like up at 5 or 6 am, at school no later than 8.30 am, study group to about 5 pm and then I have to wait for my bus that departed at 6.25 pm, in my home town at 7.30 pm and then another wait for about 30 min for a bus that took me to my apartment.

Now at home that is the only way I know how to do it. It is not something I would expect everyone to be able to do as it requires you to move quickly in the kitchen, but to me it is actually fun. It is like a little game to see if how much of your mess you can clean up before the meal is finished.

Sometimes some asshat decides they need 8 of the 13 washers so you're waiting on their shit (because one other is being used by some one else and 3 are ""Out of Order"").

Normally I would chuck in microwave meal or pizza because I am lazy/have no time...this takes as much time to 'make' and is is ultimately healthier than pizza or microwave food.

The best thing is that you can do it whenever you want, if  I want cook or go out, I just do that instead =).

I saw (online) some people living on it..like replace every meal for a month or something. Personally that would seem too bland for me...but to each their own I Guess.

sloth_sloth666,On the weekends apparently...,9ll4fn
FlannanLight,"Copying my reply from another thread:

I used to come home from work and I'd be *so __tired__*.  I wouldn't have the energy to cook so I'd bring something home with me, and then I'd veg out in front of the tv for a while, texting or browsing the internet or playing games during the commercials, because I really *had* had a hard day at work.

Then the weekend would come around and I'd have to spend at least half of it cleaning and I'd get so fucking depressed that I didn't have any time to get away for the weekends.  I was pretty sad about the whole thing, and I'd feel guilty about watching tv, and annoyed at the state of the house and the money I was spending on food, and it all just built up inside.

Then I took a good look at the annoyances in my life, resolved to do *something* about them.  They were:

* so tired when I get home that I don't want to cook, I just want some ""me time"".
* also hate spending money on takeout/pre-cooked food.
* feel guilty about watching tv instead of doing stuff around the house.
* tv ads - whether streaming or live, or even Netflix now has those stupid ""internal promotions for our own shows"" thing going on.  Time-waster!!
* housework on weekends never lets me have a free weekend off (or I feel guilty about taking a weekend off).

I thought about those things and why they annoyed me, and then I decided to use them to solve each other.  Nowadays, I clean while I stream.  Those annoying unskippable ad breaks - yeah, turn them to your advantage.  After a while, you get a pretty good feel for how long each break is.  For a typical hour-long drama:

* at the first ad break, I go to the bathroom, dump some cleaner in the toilet and swish it around the sides, clean the mirror, clear off and wash down the countertop.  Back to the tv.
* second ad break, I scrub down the shower surround.
* third ad break (the long one at the 30-minute mark), I scrub the bathtub.
* fourth ad break, clean the sink and the toilet, toss the towels in the laundry.
* last ad break, replace the towels, put everything back where it belongs, any leftover bits that need to be done.  Back to the tv.

By the time my show is done, the bathroom is sparkling clean yet it doesn't feel like I've done any work.  I don't have any guilt from watching tv, and I haven't spent commercial breaks aimlessly texting, browsing reddit/Facebook, or playing Candy Crush/Angry Birds while waiting for the show to come back on.

Mondays I clean the kitchen while I stream; Tuesday I vacuum the downstairs; Wednesday is the bathroom; Thursday is the bedrooms (Thursday usually requires 2 shows to do the bedrooms, because they're farther away and it takes time to change the bed linens, but that's okay because its Thursday and I don't really want to do anything but veg out in front of the tv anyway).  And on Friday I sit in front of the tv and chop up all the ingredients I need to cook food (I use the ad breaks to put chopped food away in the fridge, and bring fresh stuff in for chopping).

Saturday I spend an hour or so cooking two large dishes (cooking goes surprisingly fast when the ingredients are all ready to use).  They get divided into portion-sized containers, half of which get frozen.  I'll eat the dishes for lunch and dinner for several days, then eat out of the freezer for the rest of the week; I usually have 40-50 servings of 12-15 different meals in the freezer, so there's plenty of variety.  And because there's so much stuff in there, I don't feel bad if I go away for a long weekend; I can live off the freezer for a couple weeks without feeling guilty about taking time off to do stuff, I'll just spend a little more time cooking the following Saturday.

On Sunday night I sit in front of the tv and make food that I don't need to cook: I put together salads (croutons in a ziploc so they don't get soggy; dressing in an old pill bottle on the side so the salad doesn't get soggy), maybe prep some mason-jar soups.  Chop some veggies into snack-size ziplocs for lunch or snacks, set things up for some overnight oatmeal/yogurt cups.

For my daily routine: I wake up in the morning, eat some ready-made yogurt, grab my ready-made lunch+snacks, head to work.  I come home, sit down and take a break for a few minutes to recover from rush-hour traffic.  Then I'll put my dinner in the microwave.  While thats cooking, I'll stir up tomorrow's breakfast; and if its later in the week, I'll go in the freezer and grab two meals to defrost for tomorrow's lunch and dinner.  Then I'll eat my ready-made dinner.

When dinner's over, I generally find I have a bit of energy, so I'll tackle everyday communications-stuff: I'll go over my postal mail, my email, shoot off a few texts, etc, and generally take it easy.  And when 8pm rolls around, I head over to the tv for some more cleaning.

*edit*: I started doing this ... I dunno, maybe a decade ago?  As television's advanced, though, I've actually had to make sure my platforms contain *enough* ads to keep up with my needs.  I'd love to think I'd be disciplined enough to keep everything nice and clean without this method, but I figure a habitual coping method that you can rely on to work is a coping mechanism to hang on to.  I still tweak things here and there, and other people have ways that work for them, which is wonderful -- I'd never learn anything new if I wasn't hearing how everyone else does things!",9ll4fn

So cut all the fodmaps out of your diet for a bit and then slowly reintroduce one at a time to see your reaction to them.

She went back to the hospital after a couple of months, a few different occasions. The last time they took out her colon and said if they had waited 2 more weeks the ulcers would have eaten all the way through causing her to go septic. Then after a while they rebuilt the colon using her intestines, then a few months after that healed, they reconnected everything and reversed the colostomy. So 3 surgeries total but she's doing so well now. It was really hard on me.

thedomham,"Huel and soylent are really interesting. Only used soylent after I had my wisdom teeth removed because I had a friend who was really into soylent.

If you are really into soylent you can actually make it yourself which can be quite cheap. You have to be really precise though. Wouldn't actually recommend that though. 

Huel has actually [some interesting improvements compared to soylent](https://huel.com/pages/comparison-to-soylent).

But most importantly: Don't replace more than a single meal per day if you don't absolutely have to (like when you are unable to chew thanks to a surgery). It's really unhealthy to live on powdered food alone. Just scratching the surface here, but chewing and swallowing solid food is somewhat important for your psyche and your intestinal microbiota.

Nutrition is also something we know pretty little about. Scientists are still making lots of discoveries in this field. The composition of huel/soylent/et al. is just a rough guesstimate of what your body needs. How the micro- and macro nutrients are processed in your body, how much you need of them and how much it differs from person to person is, like I said, not yet an exact science.

Just because you eat something, doesn't mean you body will store it. Easiest example being vitamin C. Your body can only store a small amount at a time so when you consume much vitamin C you will pee most of it back out.

Another example is 'milk is good for your bones because calcium'. [There are some studies that disagree](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18065599?dopt=Citation).",9ll4fn
Gunt_Inspector,I'm curious about these meal replacement drinks. I would be worried I would feel full for about an hour and then feel hungry again shortly after.

And without a colon and having diarrhea 5-7 times a day, she needs to eat more than the normal 7 year old because none of the nutrients get absorbed on the way out.

> What sort of dishes do you normally make after you come home?

Copying my reply from the thread my original post was from:

I started my inspiration from the frozen foods section of my grocery store, figuring if they can freeze this stuff, so can I.  Sometimes you have to tweak the recipe or cooking method (I don't usually reheat frozen pizza in the microwave, that goes in the oven), or store stuff separately (for french onion soup, toast the bread on the side, then add it to the heated soup, top with cheese and stick it back in the microwave for 30 seconds).

Also, when I was starting out, I made some frozen breakfasts - waffles, pancakes, egg-and-cheese muffins, etc.  I stopped because waffles and pancakes generally were more eating-effort than I wanted to put in in the mornings. Plus it turns out I find something soothing in having a breakfast routine.  Also, rooting around in the freezer for breakfast and always finding lunch/dinner was a pain!  This way I have more room in the freezer for more and different dinners, so its a win all around.

Some of the items below are single-dish meals, but more likely I'll also have one of my Sunday-prepped salads as a side.  I also freeze veggies that are left over or on sale, so I can just microwave them as a side dish (broccoli, asparagus, beans), or if I feel like cooking I can use them as ingredients in a stirfry or soup or whatever else I'm making (onions [freeze in an ice cube tray, then transfer to ziplocs], celery, carrots, etc).

Food suggestions:

Casseroles are what most people think of, and there's certainly a variety of them; but you can also freeze stuff like stuffed peppers or tomatoes, meatballs (use in spaghetti or meatball sandwiches), quiches, pasties and samosas (cook these in the oven), rice and beans, pork and beans, meatloaf, chicken nuggets, stuffed potatoes, etc.

Pasta and a lot of Italian dishes tend to freeze well, so try macaroni and cheese, pasta with meat or veggies, lasagna (meat or primavera), pesto or marinara [freeze in ice cube trays, then move to ziplocs] (take a couple cubes from the bag and defrost in microwave, boil some pasta, dinner!), pizza and calzones [turn on the oven when you walk in, then toast for a few minutes so the crust isn't soggy], eggplant parmesan, manicotti, etc.

A lot of basic Spanish / Tex-Mex dishes also freeze well: empanadas, burritos, enchiladas, tacquitoes, etc.  You can also make taco or fajita filling (keep the taco shell in the pantry or tortillas in the fridge, and steal some lettuce from one of the salads).

Soups and stews also freeze well: minestrone, chowder, gumbo, lettuce soup [I have a farm share and get innundated with lettuce the first month of the season; better to make soup and freeze it than have it go bad!], french onion soup, etc.

Also, /r/mealprepsunday has some great ideas for meals that will last the week or can be frozen.  Or just google ""good homemade frozen meals"". :)",9ll4fn

your dreams are more than just random pictures passing by. if you really pay attention to them, they can actually tell you a lot about yourself, what you are afraid of, what you desire in life, your shortcomings, mistakes you've made but not quiet fully realized yet, lots of things. and it can extend past yourself and tell you about the world around you as well. it's basically a virtual world of your subconscious mind. if you have issues in your life, your dreams can help you see the solutions to them or at least help you identify them instead of living in denial/unaware of them.

BigRoach,"Most of it is just dogs being dogs that gets to be irritating, especially when they’re not your dog and you’re in a bit of a hurry to get to your next dog. They walk directly in front of you then stop abruptly. They go apeshit when they see a squirrel. They go apeshit when they see other dogs. Sometimes they step in their own poop. Some dogs eat other dogs’ poop. Some dogs eat _anything_, like maybe decroded squirrel carcasses, or even glass, or cigarette butts. They roll in poop, or decroded squirrel carcasses, or dead snakes. Just last week, I was walking a dog, and he was kind of pulling me one way a little bit so I let him go investigate whatever it was he was smelling. Then, abruptly, he flopped over and began to do that cockroach-style back wiggle thing, just flopping around in the grass.. I tried to get him up, but it was too late. As he got up I could see what looked like a squirrel in the most disgusting phase of decomposition, and he had smeared it over as much of his back and shoulders as he could before I stopped him. It was horrifying, and that smell was all over him. I had to bring that stnkin’ filthy dog home and run to my next appointment.  There was no way I had time to wash him. And I didn’t know what to tell the people. I felt so guilty, but I couldn’t help that their dog randomly flopped down on a horrifying biohazard. They’re gross loveable beasts. 

I also keep them in my home occasionally. That’s a freaking roll of the dice every time I take a new dog. I don’t have kennels or anything, so if the owner doesn’t provide me with a kennel, if the dog gets free roam in their own home, they have free roam in my place. I’ve had a couple older dogs that turned out to be incontinent (poor things) and the owner didn’t think to tell me, so I had a dog pee on my bed once, and another old bulldog just completely soaked an ottoman in piss. Sometimes dogs get sick, so you might end up cleaning diarrhea  or more frequently, puke. I surprisingly have not had any dogs chew up any furniture. But sometimes they get into the garbage. One time a dog locked me out of my house. He was kinda jumping up at the door handle and managed to lock the top deadbolt. Dumb old fella was looking through the window wondering why I wasn’t coming inside! Most recently, I had a dog get into my refrigerator. He pulled out sausages, some random veggies (which he didn’t touch) and a big Tupperware full of spicy vegetable soup. The damn thing was oddly clean and undamaged after him prying the thing open. I was furious when I came home and saw the refrigerator wide open and garbage strewn across the kitchen. ",9ll4fn

It is a 25kg dog and still growing versus a 50kg woman.

Sometimes I visit when I'm in the area and we get to walk the dog. For the first weeks the dog didn't for the hell of her what my friend wanted when she called her name when she was roaming free in the forest.

Currently in a NOT NYC apartment, I pay $425 a month for rent. We have central air, give or take $100 for utilities (electricity and internet, water's free). It's a pretty nice apartment. 1 bedroom. 1 bathroom, 2 large walk in closets, 1 broom closet, huge living room. Neighborhood is good, no danger. School is close by as well.

My cousins live in a basement in NYC. Heating doesn't work. There's no AC. The trash is placed right by their window, so you can't roll the window down either (the last time they did, they got a roach problem). They pay $4,000 a month. This right next to the biggest park in Queens, so it's not some shady area.

It's not that you can't succeed. It's that STARTING here, when the rent is 10x as much as anywhere else (and the pay isn't really much different), makes it very difficult. This is the place where uneducated parents can easily work 4-5 different part time jobs at the same time and still not have enough to pay for food at the end of the week.

,"Dear god, someone really loves washing the dishes. It's such a tedious task, in my opinion. Imagine this: you come home from a long day of work or school. You spend an hour at the grocery store and you come home, unpack, prep your food, and you spend an hour slaving over a stove cooking your dinner. During this, you throw your cooking utensils and pots and pans in the sink, letting it soak. You grab a clean plate and plop on some of that delicious dinner you made. You sit down, and being the hungry person that you are, you spend 10 minutes chowing down your food. After nearly 3 hours of hard work, you now get to do the dishes. What a treat. You start with the first pot. It's gigantic, it's heavy, and it doesn't fit in the sink. During this uncomfortable washing scenario, a spoon gets in the way and the water stream hits the concave of the spoon, splashing the water everywhere. There's water covering every inch of your skin, you've been scrubbing and washing for 10 minutes and there is no end in sight. ""Will this misery ever end?"" you ask yourself. You've been hunched over for so long that your back is starting to hurt. Even worse, your socks and clean clothes are now wet from the water. Your counter is absolutely drenched and you just know you're gonna have to wipe that down. You've been at that sink for 15 minutes and by now your hand is starting to prune. Now you have to clean the sink/drain catcher and get rid of all that nasty gunk. Alas, you have now finally finished washing your dishes. You sit there for a second and admire the beauty on an empty, glistening, stainless steel sink. Just as you finish up, your significant other/family member comes in and slides in another dish. Washing dishes is truly the WORST. ",7lta8x

Having to do dishes by hand just ruins everything for me, and I'm someone who has to have dishes done before I start on other chores because I feel they're blocking everything else.

I would rather go outside in freezing winter to take out the trash. At least then I get fresh air and a quick walk.",r1hte0

And I get easily overwhelmed by the kind of decluttering where I have to put brainpower into deciding what to keep or what to put where (when it's a mess because it didn't really have a designated place).

I'll do any tedious shit, if I don't have to put laundry away.  I'll mow the lawn.  Yardwork is my number two, but distant.

sufficientmilk,"Washing dishes. I've literally made a deal with every person I've lived with that I'll do (another awful chore) if they don't make me do dishes by hand. 

It's mainly because I've only found one dish soap that doesn't trigger eczema, and it's $9 for a very small bottle, and even that triggers my scent sensitivity. I've actually blacked out doing the dishes because of the scents of some dish soap! 

The actual act of washing them doesn't bug me that much, but I've developed such a psychological reaction from the physical side effects of doing them that I'd rather do pretty much anything else.",r1hte0

It’s meant to be an indoor/outdoor rug and it’s durable, but it has these long-ass fibers that trap an endless number of dried grass blades, leaves and leaf bits.
